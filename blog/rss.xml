            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh Q&amp;amp;A" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-q&amp;a-5ee3460631a40ccb4ab675860e9bddd7.jpeg" width="3126" height="1043" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>At KubeCon EU 2022, the <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> team hosted two activities "Make Cloud Native Chaos Engineering Easier - Deep Dive into Chaos Mesh" and "office hours session". We are very grateful and enjoyed it with all of you very much. We shared with each other, got to know each other, and discussed a lot of things in depth.</p><p>For the presentations, we gave a brief overview of Chaos Mesh, then delved into how Chaos Mesh is implemented and how it is practiced, and shared the team's latest explorations around chaos engineering and plans for Chaos Mesh's development.</p><p>For Office Hour, we introduced the Chaos Mesh project and its latest progress, and answered online questions from attendees.</p><p>Many thanks to each of our friends that came out to support us! And for Office Hour, we received some great questions and we decided to have a follow-up Q&amp;A.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="your-questions-answered">Your questions answered<a href="#your-questions-answered" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Your questions answered" title="Direct link to Your questions answered">​</a></h2><p><strong>Q: Does chaos play well with Windows/Linux hybrid clusters?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Chaos Mesh can only work with Linux now, but we have kindly contributors who are trying to port some features to Windows: <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/issues/2956" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/issues/2956</a></p><p><strong>Q: I think Istio and Linkerd also support fault injection. How does Chaos Mesh differ? Chaos Mesh provides much richer chaos injections (like IOChaos, TimeChaos...), but the injection provided by linked or istio, as I know, is focused on the network?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yeah of course! Service Mesh Frameworks have the potential to cause havoc in the RPC/Network layer. More types of chaos, such as stresschaos, pod kill, DNSChaos, and IOChaos, could be injected into Chaos Mesh (just mentioned) In addition to the list, we offer additional types of chaos. JVM, GCP, Azure, and so on...</p><p><strong>Q: As part of the chaos mesh can we run any pre-initialization scripts before introducing the chaos experiment?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes! You may organize your customized scripts and various chaotic experiments together with Chaos Mesh's integrated Workflow engine. See <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/next/create-chaos-mesh-workflow/#task-field-description" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">task field in workflow</a> for the document.</p><p><strong>Q: Is this similar to the Gremlin Chaos engineering tool?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, this is a Kubernetes-specific open-source project. It's a Kubernetes plugin that you can utilize. You can get more Infos on <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://chaos-mesh.org</a></p><p><strong>Q: How does it inject network latency for network chaos? if we use cilium CNI with no iptables, would this latency injection still work in that case?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Chaos Mesh has a chaos-daemon component. When network chaos is produced, chaos-daemon will enter the target pod's network namespace and set TC and iptables rules on the network device.</p><p>When using clium CNI without iptables, Chaos Mesh still works.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="join-the-chaos-mesh-community">Join the Chaos Mesh community<a href="#join-the-chaos-mesh-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Join the Chaos Mesh community" title="Direct link to Join the Chaos Mesh community">​</a></h2><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh and would like to help us improve it, you're welcome to join <a href="https://slack.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Slack channel</a>(#project-chaos-mesh) or submit your pull requests or issues to our <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Experience as an LFX Mentee for Chaos Mesh" src="/assets/images/lfx-mentee-experience-banner-69b87cf6f4a6a751404a33fd8d42af63.png" width="1600" height="530" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>I am a graduate student studying software engineering at Nanjing University. My research focuses on DevOps, which has intrinsic connections with chaos engineering and observability. To get involved in the open-source community, understand Kubernetes more deeply, and experience the daily jobs around infrastructure, I applied for the CNCF LFX Mentorship in Fall 2021 to work on the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="application-process">Application Process<a href="#application-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Application Process" title="Direct link to Application Process">​</a></h2><p>At the end of August, I finished an internship of a business nature. As expected, I decided that I was not much into business-related work. However, I always had a strong passion for infrastructure technologies. By chance, I discovered the Chaos Mesh project at CNCF LFX Mentorship.I thought this was a great opportunity to work on an open source project, which I had been dreaming about. I also had the right technology stack, so I submitted my resume right before the deadline.</p><p>Three days later, I received an interview email from my mentor. As part of the interview, the mentor left a small piece of homework - to write a mini-node-exporter that would expose Prometheus metrics and present them in the Grafana dashboard. I was also required to deploy the mini-node-exporter, the configured Prometheus, and Grafana dashboard on the Kubernetes platform. The design and implementation process was very smooth. The only difficulty was to write the Grafana dashboard as a configuration YAML for the Kubernetes deployment. After a series of queries through documentation and experiments, this problem was finally solved.</p><p>On August 30, I was lucky enough to receive the good news that I passed the interview. During the one-on-one meeting with the mentor, we simply talked about my familiarity with Kubernetes and other technologies, the main tasks, and some key timelines. I also raised some concerns, such as the pressure of my graduate lab project that might affect the progress of the mentorship, and the design guidelines of the metrics. My mentor understood me well and addressed my concerns.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="project-process">Project Process<a href="#project-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Process" title="Direct link to Project Process">​</a></h2><p>The project I applied for was called <a href="https://mentorship.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/project/8db683b0-0273-4a83-9ed9-4c33ee2cfcf0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monitoring Metrics about Chaos Mesh</a>, which aimed to improve the observability of the Chaos Mesh system by collecting metrics and providing a Grafana dashboard.</p><p>During the first two weeks of the project, I got familiar with the business process and some code details of chaos mesh. In the next two weeks, I started to write the design document to sort out all the metrics and collection methods. During this time, I studied the metric design guidelines and met with the mentor to understand the details of the proposal and some of the code logic.</p><p>Most of these metrics are relatively simple to collect, requiring only simple queries to database objects, k8s objects, or some simple counts. However, there are some special metrics that are difficult to collect. For example, you need to query the data by executing commands in the network namespace of the corresponding container, or query all the containers under the daemon through three different container runtimes, or collect data on the communication between the gRPC client and the server.</p><p>These tasks were strange to me. Therefore, I had to ask my mentor for technical support from time to time, and he was always very responsive. I was greatly impressed by my mentor’s extensive knowledge and experience in this field. Under the guidance from my mentor, I was finally able to put together the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/rfcs/pull/23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC</a> document for my design. Later, in order to track my work, I created a <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/issues/2397" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tracking issue</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Tracking issue" src="/assets/images/lfx-mentee-experience-tracking-issue-7ea5bc9c4a4193bbfc5b1e8c449de2a9.png" width="851" height="972" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>However, during the subsequent coding work, I encountered various problems. In retrospect, I found that many of them could have been solved in advance. So I have summarized some suggestions below:</p><p><strong>Keep thinking critically</strong>. When I accepted the proposal, I proposed my solution for each metric off the top of my head, but ignored some basic questions: are these metrics necessary? Do we have a better solution that’s available? These basic questions should have been addressed during the proposal phase, but they were propagated to the later design implementation phase. For example, when submitting the RFC, I was reminded by my mentor and reviewers that some metrics were already implemented in the controller-runtime library. When I was working on BPM-related metrics, I was asked similarly by the reviewer. Only then did I realize that I had never paid attention to it.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Comments about BPM metrics" src="/assets/images/lfx-mentee-experience-thinking-critically-fcd1d0475090c15217fac74a711df8ef.png" width="558" height="536" class="img_eJzl"></p><p><strong>Continuous communication</strong>. How to communicate effectively is a very important issue in this mentorship. There are many lessons learned about communication, but the most profound is that it is better to give options before getting advice. When you have to ask for help, provide some options for the other party to reference. Although these options may not be valid, it contains your own thinking. Therefore, unless you still have no idea after thinking things through, don’t put other people in the middle of your questions.</p><p><strong>Understand open source</strong>. This is my first actual experience with open source. Compared with working in a company, things are a lot different. Here are some examples:</p><ol><li><p>The way information is synchronized. Unlike working in a company where we communicate often with face-to-face meetings, basically most of the communications with an open source community are concentrated in slack channels, GitHub issues, and pull requests. Therefore, we need to record our work so that we can always let other folks know what is going on. In the first few weeks, I maintained an online R&amp;D document based on my previous habit. Later I found that it was better to set up a Kanban or issue on GitHub, so that I would not introduce additional communication cost for my mentor by using a different platform.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Online R&amp;amp;D document" src="/assets/images/lfx-mentee-experience-rd-doc-61a0b04340778b07db56a096231feb5e.png" width="925" height="647" class="img_eJzl"></p></li><li><p>Better and more rigorous automated testing. For business companies, automated testing only includes static code analysis, unit testing and simple smoke testing, while manual testing will be more rigorous. But in open source projects, the automated code pipeline contains more detailed and complete test cases, such as integration testing, end-to-end testing, license checking, and so on. The quality and security of the submitted code will be checked initially in this phase.</p></li><li><p>Code review. Many people will participate in your code reviews, and the review may last for a long time. Unlike company work, there are no dedicated reviewers in an open source community. It could be users, maintainers, or other community members who are either assigned or voluntarily do the job, which may be part of the reason for the long review duration.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="after-the-project">After the project<a href="#after-the-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to After the project" title="Direct link to After the project">​</a></h2><p>I had a wonderful experience in these 12 weeks. I gained a deeper understanding of Kubernetes, CRD, and observability. I also realized that I was still lacking a lot of knowledge on how to improve code structure, Linux basics, and container technologies. There is still more to learn!</p><p>At the same time, because of the unexpected pressure of the graduate lab project, I didn’t have much dedicated time for the mentorship. I didn’t even get to finish the design of the Grafana part within the time frame. I will definitely follow up with it and hope to finish it successfully and give a real conclusion to this project.</p><p>I would like to thank my mentor <a href="https://github.com/STRRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@STRRL</a>. During my internship, I encountered many problems in the project, such as Git operations, cycle dependency solutions, and finding the runtime interface for CRI-O. Without my mentor's patience and guidance, it would have been difficult for me to complete these unfamiliar technical challenges. I would also like to thank the maintainers of Chaos Mesh for reviewing my code, and the CNCF LFX Mentorship project for providing a great platform for all of us who want to participate in the open-source community.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Mentor&amp;#39;s LGTM" src="/assets/images/lfx-mentee-experience-mentors-lgtm-d408ab5a3921965164faf556fe5fa653.png" width="592" height="143" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Finally, I hope every student who wants to be part of the open-source community can take the first step with LFX Mentorship!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="How to Develop a Daily Reporting System to Track Chaos Testing Results" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-digitalchina-banner-c7d6ac176f56621aa799af0e30d06e96.png" width="1501" height="501" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Chaos Mesh is a cloud-native chaos engineering platform that orchestrates chaos experiments on Kubernetes environments. It allows you to test the resilience of your system by simulating problems such as network faults, file system faults, and Pod faults. After each chaos experiment, you can review the testing results by checking the logs. But this is neither direct nor efficient. Therefore, I decided to develop a daily reporting system that would automatically analyze logs and generate reports. This way, it’s easy to examine the logs and identify the issues.</p><p>In this article, I will give you some insights about how to build a daily reporting system, as well as the problems I encountered during the process and how I fixed them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="deploy-chaos-mesh-on-kubernetes">Deploy Chaos Mesh on Kubernetes<a href="#deploy-chaos-mesh-on-kubernetes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deploy Chaos Mesh on Kubernetes" title="Direct link to Deploy Chaos Mesh on Kubernetes">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh is designed for Kubernetes, which is one of the important reasons why it can allow users to inject faults into the file system, Pod, or network for specific applications.</p><p>In earlier documents, Chaos Mesh offered two ways to quickly deploy a virtual Kubernetes cluster on your machine: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kind</a> and <a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minikube</a>. Generally, it only takes a one-line command to deploy a Kubernetes cluster as well as install Chaos Mesh. But there are some problems:</p><ul><li>Starting Kubernetes clusters locally affects network-related fault types.</li><li>Users on the Chinese mainland might experience an extremely slow process to pull the Docker image or even a timeout.</li></ul><p>If you use the provided script to deploy a Kubernetes cluster using kind, all Kubernetes nodes are virtual machines (VM). This adds difficulty when you pull the image offline. To address this issue, you can deploy the Kubernetes cluster on multiple physical machines instead, with each physical machine acting as a worker node. To expedite the image pulling process, you can use the <code>docker load</code> command to load the required image in advance. Apart from the two problems above, you can install <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kubectl</a> and <a href="https://helm.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Helm</a> by following the documentation.</p><p>Note: For the latest installation and deployment instructions, refer to <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/quick-start/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh Quick Start</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="deploy-tidb">Deploy TiDB<a href="#deploy-tidb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deploy TiDB" title="Direct link to Deploy TiDB">​</a></h2><p>The next step is to deploy TiDB on Kubernetes. I used TiDB Operator to streamline the process. For details, check out <a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb-in-kubernetes/stable/get-started" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Get started with TiDB Operator in Kubernetes</a>.</p><p>I’d like to highlight two points in this process:</p><ul><li>First, install Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) to implement different components of TiDB Operator. Otherwise, you’ll get errors when you try to install TiDB Operator.</li><li>Use <a href="https://longhorn.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Longhorn</a>, a distributed block storage system for Kubernetes, to create local persistent volumes (PV) for your Kubernetes cluster. This way, you don’t have to create PVs in advance: whenever a Pod is pulled, a PV is automatically created and mounted.</li></ul><p>The biggest problem that I encountered was that pulling the image could be extremely slow when deploying the service. If the nodes in your Kubernetes cluster are virtual machines, pull the required images in advance and load them to the Docker of each machine:</p><div class="language-bash codeBlockContainer_lDW9 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_gKCn"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-bash codeBlock_Vp2e thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_M2tE"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(98, 114, 164)">## Pull required images on a machine with a good network connection</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> pull pingcap/tikv:latest</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> pull pingcap/tidb:latest</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> pull pingcap/pd:latest</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(98, 114, 164)">## Export images and save them to each machine in the Kubernetes cluster</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> save -o tikv.tar pingcap/tikv:latest</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> save -o tidb.tar pingcap/tidb:latest</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> save -o pd.tar pingcap/pd:latest</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain" style="display:inline-block"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token comment" style="color:rgb(98, 114, 164)">## Load images to each machine</span><span class="token plain"></span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> load </span><span class="token operator">&amp;</span><span class="token plain">lt</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><span class="token plain"> tikv.tar</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> load </span><span class="token operator">&amp;</span><span class="token plain">lt</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><span class="token plain"> tidb.tar</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain"></span><span class="token function" style="color:rgb(80, 250, 123)">docker</span><span class="token plain"> load </span><span class="token operator">&amp;</span><span class="token plain">lt</span><span class="token punctuation" style="color:rgb(248, 248, 242)">;</span><span class="token plain"> pd.tar</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_IyHw"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_d7vL" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_yBVr" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LYGl" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>The above commands allow you to use the TiDB image in the local Docker registry to deploy the latest TiDB cluster, saving you the trouble of pulling the image from the remote repository.

In the example below, I imported the pressure measurement results and created a line graph to show how queries per second (QPS) were affected when a specific Pod became unavailable. Since the chaos experiment was executed periodically, the number of QPS exhibited a pattern: it would drop abruptly and then quickly return to normal.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="QPS line graph" src="/assets/images/qps-line-graph-10389785bbe639db08850f5d73c47239.png" width="678" height="356" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">QPS line graph</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="generate-the-report-in-pdf">Generate the report in PDF<a href="#generate-the-report-in-pdf" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Generate the report in PDF" title="Direct link to Generate the report in PDF">​</a></h3><p>Currently, there is no available API for generating Chaos Mesh reports or analyzing results. I decided to generate the report in PDF format so it would be readable on different browsers. In my case, I used <a href="https://github.com/signintech/gopdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gopdf</a>, a support library that allows users to create PDF files. It also lets me insert images or draw tables, which meets my needs.</p><p>To generate a daily report, I used <a href="https://www.linux.org/docs/man8/cron.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crond</a>, a command-line utility that executes cron jobs in the background, to execute the commands early each morning. So, when I start work, there is a daily report waiting for me.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="build-a-web-application-for-daily-reporting">Build a web application for daily reporting<a href="#build-a-web-application-for-daily-reporting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Build a web application for daily reporting" title="Direct link to Build a web application for daily reporting">​</a></h2><p>But I want to make the report more readable and accessible. Isn’t it nicer if you can check reports on a web application? At first, I wanted to add a backend API and track when the report was generated. It sounds applicable but it may be too much work since all I want is to know which report requires further troubleshooting. The exact information is shown in the file name, for example: <code>report-2021-07-09-bad.pdf</code>. Thus, the reporting system’s workload and complexity are greatly reduced.</p><p>Still, it is necessary to improve the backend interfaces as well as enrich the report content. But for now, a daily, workable reporting system is just fine.</p><p>In my case, I used <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vue.js</a> to scaffold the web application using a UI library <a href="https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">antd</a>. After that, I updated the page content by saving the automatically generated report to the static resources folder <code>static</code>. This allows the web application to read the static reports and then render them to the front end page. For details, check out <a href="https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/use-with-vue-cli/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Use antd in vue-cli 3</a>.</p><p>Below is an example of a web application that I developed for daily reporting. The red card indicates that I should take a look at the testing report because exceptions are thrown after running chaos experiments.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Web application for daily reporting" src="/assets/images/web-app-for-daily-reporting-3fc7adf871410eb6a52f15ac84c00d5b.png" width="1999" height="580" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Web application for daily reporting</p><p>Clicking the red card will open the report, as shown below. I used <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pdf.js</a> to view the PDF.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Daily report in PDF" src="/assets/images/daily-report-pdf-8ae60cf1beb170450c7fd87443084175.png" width="930" height="841" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Daily report in PDF</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh enables you to simulate faults that most cloud-native applications might encounter. In this article, I created a PodChaos experiment and observed that QPS in the TiDB cluster was affected when the Pod became unavailable. After analyzing the logs, I can enhance the robustness and high availability of the system. I built a web application to generate daily reports for troubleshooting and debugging. You can also customize the reports to meet your own requirements.</p><p>Our team is also working on a project to <a href="https://github.com/DigitalChinaOpenSource/TiDB-for-PostgreSQL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make TiDB compatible with PostgreSQL</a>. If you are interested and want to make contributions, you are welcome to pick an issue and get started.</p><p><strong>Originally published at <em><a href="https://thenewstack.io/develop-a-daily-reporting-system-for-chaos-mesh-to-improve-system-resilience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Stack</a></em>.</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

You can use Chaos Mesh to conveniently inject failures and simulate abnormalities that might occur in reality, so you can identify potential problems in your system. Chaos Mesh also offers a Chaos Dashboard which allows you to monitor the status of a chaos experiment. However, this dashboard cannot let you observe how the failures in the experiment impact the service performance of applications. This hinders us from further testing our systems and finding potential problems.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/skywalking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache SkyWalking</a> is an open-source application performance monitor (APM), specially designed to monitor, track, and diagnose cloud native, container-based distributed systems. It collects events that occur and then displays them on its dashboard, allowing you to observe directly the type and number of events that have occurred in your system and how different events impact the service performance.</p><p>When you use SkyWalking and Chaos Mesh together during chaos experiments, you can observe how different failures impact the service performance.</p><p>This tutorial will show you how to configure SkyWalking and Chaos Mesh. You’ll also learn how to leverage the two systems to monitor events and observe in real time how chaos experiments impact applications’ service performance.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="preparation">Preparation<a href="#preparation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Preparation" title="Direct link to Preparation">​</a></h2><p>Before you start to use SkyWalking and Chaos Mesh, you have to:</p><ul><li>Set up a SkyWalking cluster according to <a href="https://github.com/apache/skywalking-kubernetes#install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the SkyWalking configuration guide</a>.</li><li>Deploy Chao Mesh <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/production-installation-using-helm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using Helm</a>.</li><li>Install <a href="https://jmeter.apache.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JMeter</a> or other Java testing tools (to increase service loads).</li><li>Configure SkyWalking and Chaos Mesh according to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh-on-skywalking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this guide</a> if you just want to run a demo.</li></ul><p>Now, you are fully prepared, and we can cut to the chase.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="step-1-access-the-skywalking-cluster">Step 1: Access the SkyWalking cluster<a href="#step-1-access-the-skywalking-cluster" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 1: Access the SkyWalking cluster" title="Direct link to Step 1: Access the SkyWalking cluster">​</a></h2><p>After you install the SkyWalking cluster, you can access its user interface (UI). However, no service is running at this point, so before you start monitoring, you have to add one and set the agents.</p><p>In this tutorial, we take Spring Boot, a lightweight microservice framework, as an example to build a simplified demo environment.</p><ol><li>Create a SkyWalking demo in Spring Boot by referring to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh-on-skywalking/blob/master/demo-deployment.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this document</a>.</li><li>Execute the command <code>kubectl apply -f demo-deployment.yaml -n skywalking</code> to deploy the demo.</li></ol><p>After you finish deployment, you can observe the real-time monitoring results at the SkyWalking UI.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Spring Boot and SkyWalking have the same default port number: 8080. Be careful when you configure the port forwarding; otherise, you may have port conflicts. For example, you can set Spring Boot’s port to 8079 by using a command like <code>kubectl port-forward svc/spring-boot-skywalking-demo 8079:8080 -n skywalking</code> to avoid conflicts.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="step-2-deploy-skywalking-kubernetes-event-exporter">Step 2: Deploy SkyWalking Kubernetes Event Exporter<a href="#step-2-deploy-skywalking-kubernetes-event-exporter" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 2: Deploy SkyWalking Kubernetes Event Exporter" title="Direct link to Step 2: Deploy SkyWalking Kubernetes Event Exporter">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/skywalking-kubernetes-event-exporter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SkyWalking Kubernetes Event Exporter</a> is able to watch, filter, and send Kubernetes events into the SkyWalking backend. SkyWalking then associates the events with the system metrics and displays an overview about when and how the metrics are affected by the events.</p><p>If you want to deploy SkyWalking Kubernetes Event Explorer with one line of commands, refer to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh-on-skywalking/blob/master/exporter-deployment.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this document</a> to create configuration files in YAML format and then customize the parameters in the filters and exporters. Now, you can use the command <code>kubectl apply</code> to deploy SkyWalking Kubernetes Event Explorer.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="step-3-use-jmeter-to-increase-service-loads">Step 3: Use JMeter to increase service loads<a href="#step-3-use-jmeter-to-increase-service-loads" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 3: Use JMeter to increase service loads" title="Direct link to Step 3: Use JMeter to increase service loads">​</a></h2><p>To better observe the change in service performance, you need to increase the service loads on Spring Boot. In this tutorial, we use JMeter, a widely adopted Java testing tool, to increase the service loads.</p><p>Perform a stress test on <code>localhost:8079</code> using JMeter and add five threads to continuously increase the service loads.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="JMeter Dashboard 1" src="/assets/images/jmeter-1-57604bd61820a513fba79f7e3fe622a5.png" width="1156" height="517" class="img_eJzl"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="JMeter Dashboard 2" src="/assets/images/jmeter-2-5286dd8271fc4872d751d69f04c955a2.png" width="1525" height="429" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Open the SkyWalking Dashboard. You can see that the access rate is 100%, and that the service loads reach about 5,300 calls per minute (CPM).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="SkyWalking Dashboard" src="/assets/images/skywalking-dashboard-be15b01a2de79a2abddad3f33fc15346.png" width="1919" height="934" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="step-4-inject-failures-via-chaos-mesh-and-observe-results">Step 4: Inject failures via Chaos Mesh and observe results<a href="#step-4-inject-failures-via-chaos-mesh-and-observe-results" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Step 4: Inject failures via Chaos Mesh and observe results" title="Direct link to Step 4: Inject failures via Chaos Mesh and observe results">​</a></h2><p>After you finish the three steps above, you can use the Chaos Dashboard to simulate stress scenarios and observe the change in service performance during chaos experiments.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="StressChaos on Chaos Dashboard" src="/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-stresschaos-0958f21ef5a185aa16e9c2327a226fe0.png" width="1918" height="935" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>The following sections describe how service performance varies under the stress of three chaos conditions:</p><ul><li><p>CPU load: 10%; memory load: 128 MB</p><p>The first chaos experiment simulates low CPU usage. To display when a chaos experiment starts and ends, click the switching button on the right side of the dashboard. To learn whether the experiment is Applied to the system or Recovered from the system, move your cursor onto the short, green line.</p><p>During the time period between the two short, green lines, the service load decreases to 4,929 CPM, but returns to normal after the chaos experiment ends.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Test 1" src="/assets/images/cpuload-1-3188bd3a6afc8e73e4e8723b58518b20.png" width="722" height="316" class="img_eJzl"></p></li><li><p>CPU load: 50%; memory load: 128 MB</p><p>When the application’s CPU load increases to 50%, the service load decreases to 4,307 CPM.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Test 2" src="/assets/images/cpuload-2-1ef91964d35ba5f9bceef75075756250.png" width="724" height="321" class="img_eJzl"></p></li><li><p>CPU load: 100%; memory load: 128 MB</p><p>When the CPU usage is at 100%, the service load decreases to only 40% of what it would be if no chaos experiments were taking place.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Test 3" src="/assets/images/cpuload-3-8630b8200eca779f6f534a29ac08a65e.png" width="725" height="321" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Because the process scheduling under the Linux system does not allow a process to occupy the CPU all the time, the deployed Spring Boot Demo can still handle 40% of the access requests even in the extreme case of a full CPU load.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>By combining SkyWalking and Chaos Mesh, you can clearly observe when and to what extent chaos experiments affect application service performance. This combination of tools lets you observe the service performance in various extreme conditions, thus boosting your confidence in your services.</p><p>Chaos Mesh has grown a lot in 2021 thanks to the unremitting efforts of all PingCAP engineers and community contributors.

client based on the Pod information. For example, to control a Pod on a node, it creates a client by getting the <code>ClusterIP</code> of the node where the Pod is located. If the Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate configuration exists, Controller Manager adds the TLS certificate for the client.</p><p>When Chaos Daemon starts, if it has a TLS certificate it attaches the certificate to enable gRPCS. The TLS configuration option <code>RequireAndVerifyClientCert</code> indicates whether to enable mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication.</p><div class="language-go codeBlockContainer_lDW9 theme-code-block"

<code>pbClient.SetNetem</code> to encapsulate parameters into a request and send the request to the Chaos Daemon on the node for processing.</p><p>The network failure injection code is shown below as it appeared in 2019. As the project developed, the functions were distributed among several files.</p><div class="language-go codeBlockContainer_lDW9 theme-code-block"

I've seen this processing mode in <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>hashicorp/go-plugin</code></a>, and go-plugin does this better.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="io-fault-injection">I/O fault injection<a href="#io-fault-injection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I/O fault injection" title="Direct link to I/O fault injection">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/826" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pull request #826</a> introduces a new implementation of IOChaos, without the use of sidecar injection. It uses Chaos Daemon to directly manipulate the Linux namespace through the underlying commands of the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">runc</a> container and runs the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaos-mesh/toda</a> FUSE program developed by Rust to inject container I/O chaos. The <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/rpc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSON-RPC 2.0</a> protocol is used to communicate between toda and the control plane.</p><p>The new IOChaos implementation doesn't modify the Pod resources. When you define the IOChaos chaos experiment, for each Pod filtered by the selector field, a corresponding PodIOChaos resource is created. PodIoChaos' <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/owners-dependents/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">owner reference</a> is the Pod. At the same time, a set of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finalizers</a> is added to PodIoChaos to release PodIoChaos resources before PodIoChaos is deleted.</p><div class="language-go codeBlockContainer_lDW9 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div

the Apache 2.0 protocol. As discussed above, it has rich capabilities and a good ecosystem. The maintenance team developed the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>chaos-mesh/toda</code></a> FUSE based on the chaos system, the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/k8s_dns_chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>chaos-mesh/k8s_dns_chaos</code></a> CoreDNS chaos plug-in, and Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF)-based kernel error injection <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/bpfki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>chaos-mesh/bpfki</code></a>.</p><p>Now, I'll describe the server side code required to build an end-user-oriented chaos engineering platform. This implementation is only an example—not necessarily the best example. If you want to see the development practice on a real world platform, you can refer to Chaos Mesh's <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/tree/master/pkg/dashboard" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dashboard</a>. It uses the <a href="https://github.com/uber-go/fx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>uber-go/fx</code></a> dependency injection framework and the controller runtime's manager mode.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="key-chaos-mesh-features">Key Chaos Mesh features<a href="#key-chaos-mesh-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key Chaos Mesh features" title="Direct link to Key Chaos Mesh features">​</a></h3><p>As shown in the Chaos Mesh workflow below, we need to implement a server that sends YAML to the Kubernetes API. Chaos Controller Manager implements complex rule verification and rule delivery to Chaos Daemon. If you want to use Chaos Mesh with your own platform, you only need to connect to the process of creating CRD resources.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh&amp;#39;s basic workflow"

can view all chaos experiments' implementation status and manage them. To achieve this, we can call the <code>REST</code> API to send the <code>Get</code> or <code>List</code> request. But in practice, we need to pay attention to the details. At our company, we've noticed that each time the controller requests the full amount of resource data, the load of the Kubernetes API server increases.</p><p>I recommend that you read the <a href="https://zoetrope.github.io/kubebuilder-training/controller-runtime/client.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How to use the controller-runtime client</a> (in Japanese) controller runtime tutorial. If you don't understand Japanese, you can still learn a lot from the tutorial by reading the source code. It covers many details. For example, by default, the controller runtime reads kubeconfig, flags, environment variables, and the service account automatically mounted in the Pod from multiple locations. <a href="https://github.com/armosec/kubescape/pull/21" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pull request #21</a> for <a href="https://github.com/armosec/kubescape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>armosec/kubescape</code></a> uses this feature. This tutorial also includes common operations, such as how to paginate, update, and overwrite objects. I haven't seen any English tutorials that are so detailed.</p><p>Here are examples of <code>Get</code> and <code>List</code> requests:</p><div class="language-go codeBlockContainer_lDW9

With Chaos Mesh, you can simulate a variety of failures, and use Chaos Dashboard, a web UI, to manage chaos experiments directly. Since it was open-sourced, Chaos Mesh has been adopted by many companies to ensure their systems’ resilience and robustness. But over the past year, we have frequently heard requests from the community asking how to run chaos experiments when the services are not deployed on Kubernetes.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="what-is-chaosd">What is chaosd<a href="#what-is-chaosd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is chaosd" title="Direct link to What is chaosd">​</a></h2><p>To meet the growing needs of chaos testing on physical machines, we are excited to present an enhanced toolkit called chaosd. You might find the name familiar. That’s because it evolved from <code>chaos-daemon</code>, a key component in Chaos Mesh. At TiDB Hackathon 2020, we <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/chaos-mesh-remake-one-step-closer-toward-chaos-as-a-service#refactor-chaosd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refactored chaosd to make it more than a command-line tool</a>. Now with <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaosd/releases/tag/v1.0.1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaosd v1.0.1</a>, you can simulate specific errors that target physical machines, and then, undo the chaos experiments like nothing had happened.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="benefits-of-chaosd">Benefits of chaosd<a href="#benefits-of-chaosd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Benefits of chaosd" title="Direct link to Benefits of chaosd">​</a></h2><p>chaosd has the following advantages:</p><ul><li><strong>Easy-to-use</strong>: You can easily create and manage chaos experiments with chaosd commands.</li><li><strong>Various fault types</strong>: You can simulate faults to be injected on physical machines at different levels, including process faults, network faults, Java Virtual Machine (JVM) application faults, stress scenarios, disk faults, and host faults.</li><li><strong>Multiple work modes</strong>: You can use chaosd as a command-line tool or as a service.</li></ul><p>Without further ado, let’s give it a try.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="how-to-use-chaosd">How to use chaosd<a href="#how-to-use-chaosd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How to use chaosd" title="Direct link to How to use chaosd">​</a></h2><p>In this section, I will walk you through how to inject a network fault with chaosd.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Securing Online Gaming: Combine Chaos Engineering with DevOps Practices" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-tencent-ieg-3119a610ddb42163cb244e562167f680.jpeg" width="1200" height="400" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Interactive Entertainment Group (IEG) is a division of Tencent Holdings that focuses on the development of online video games and other digital content such as live broadcasts. It is well-known for being the publisher of some of the most popular video games.</p><p>In this article, I will explain why and how we introduce chaos engineering into our DevOps process.</p><p>For each day, we handle over 10,000,000 total visits, and, during peak hours, we process over 1,000,000 queries per second (QPS). To guarantee players a fun and engaging experience, we launch various daily or seasonal game events. Sometimes, that means we must update the event code over 500 times per day. As our user base grows, the total amount of data quickly multiplies. Currently, the figure stands at 200 terabytes. We have to manage the massive user queries and rapid release iterations, and we managed it well.</p><p>A cloud-native DevOps solution frees our events operator from the growing number of online events. We developed a pipeline that takes care of everything they need, from writing code to launching events in production environments: once new event codes are detected, the operation platform automatically builds images from them and deploys the image to Tencent Kubernetes Engine (TKE). You might be wondering how long this entire automated process takes: only 5 minutes.</p><p>Currently, almost all IEG operation services run in TKE. Elastic scaling promises faster capacity expansion and reduction of cloud services thanks to cloud-native technology.</p><p>In addition, we expect the iterations to be easier. A best practice is to break down the large, hard-to-maintain service into many “smaller” services that we can maintain independently. “Small” services have less code and simpler logic, with lower handover and training costs. We as developers continue to practice this kind of microservices architecture as part of DevOps initiatives. Yet similar issues persist. As the number of services increases, so does the complexity of making calls between them. <strong>Worse, if one “small” service fails, it could set off a chain reaction that brings all the services down—a microservice dependency hell.</strong></p><p>The thing is, fault tolerance varies by service. Some support downgrading, while others don’t. Not to mention that some services are unable to provide timely alerts or lack an effective debugging tool. As a result, debugging services has become a tricky and increasingly pressing issue in our day-to-day work.</p><p>But we can’t just let it be. What if the unstable performance constantly chases our players away? What if there is a catastrophic failure?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="let-there-be-faults">Let there be faults<a href="#let-there-be-faults" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Let there be faults" title="Direct link to Let there be faults">​</a></h2><p>Netflix introduced the idea of chaos engineering. This approach tests the resilience of the system against all kinds of edgy cases by injecting faults in a non-production environment to achieve ideal system reliability. According to one Gartner article, by 2023, 40% of organizations will use chaos engineering to meet their top DevOps objectives, reducing unplanned downtime by 20%.</p><p>This is exactly how we avoid the worst-case scenario. Fault injection, in my opinion, is now a must-do in every technical team. In our early test cases, developers would bring down a node before launching a service to see if the primary node automatically switched to the secondary node and if disaster recovery worked.</p><p><strong>But chaos engineering is more than fault injection.</strong> It is a field that constantly drives new techniques, professional testing tools, and solid theories. That’s why we continue to explore it.</p><p>IEG officially launched its chaos engineering project over a year ago. We wanted to do this right the first time. The key is to select a chaos engineering tool that supports running experiments in the Kubernetes environment. <strong>After a careful comparison, we believe <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> is our best option</strong> because:</p><ul><li>It is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Sandbox project with a friendly and productive community.</li><li>It does not intrude on existing applications.</li><li>It provides a web UI and a variety of fault injection types, as shown in the image below.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A comparison of chaos engineering tools" src="/assets/images/comparison-of-chaos-engineering-tools-7dba9d470020b2a7250e50e1413aec74.png" width="1080" height="712" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center"> A comparison of chaos engineering tools </p><blockquote><p>Note: This comparison is outdated and is intended simply to compare fault injection features supported by Chaos Mesh with other well-known chaos engineering platforms.

As shown in the diagram below, Chaos Mesh now plays an important role in our operation platform. We use Chaos Mesh's dashboard API to create, run, and delete chaos experiments and monitor them on our own platform. We can simulate basic system-level faults in Pods, container, network, and IO.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh embedded in IEG&amp;#39;s operation platform" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-embedded-in-IEG's-operation-platform-afaf1b549e9a7d2b6103a16dfb6eb4c6.png" width="1999" height="915" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Chaos Mesh embedded in IEG's operation platform</p><p>In IEG, <strong>chaos engineering is generally summarized as a closed loop with several key phases</strong>:</p><ul><li><p>Improve overall system resilience.</p><p>Build a chaos testing platform that we can modify as our needs change.</p></li><li><p>Design a testing plan.</p><p>The testing plan must specify the target, scope, fault to be injected, monitoring metrics, etc. Make sure the testing is well-controlled.</p></li><li><p>Execute chaos experiments and review the results.</p><p>Compare the system’s performance before and after the chaos experiment.</p></li><li><p>Resolve any issues that may arise.</p><p>Fix found issues and upgrade the system for the follow-up experiment.</p></li><li><p>Repeat chaos experiments and verify performance.</p><p>Repeat chaos experiments to see if the system’s performance meets expectations.

We begin by orchestrating and scheduling experiments. Following that, we run experiments and monitor the performance of related services. Multiple monitoring metrics, such as QPS, latency, response success, are immediately visible through the operation platform. The platform then generates reports for us to review, so we can check whether these experiments met our expectations.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="use-cases">Use cases<a href="#use-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Use cases" title="Direct link to Use cases">​</a></h2><p>The following are a few examples of how we use chaos engineering in our DevOps workflow.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="finer-granularity-of-fault-injection">Finer granularity of fault injection<a href="#finer-granularity-of-fault-injection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Finer granularity of fault injection" title="Direct link to Finer granularity of fault injection">​</a></h3><p>There is no need to shut down the entire system to see if our games are still available to players. Sometimes we only want to inject faults, say, network latency, into a single game account, and observe how it responds. We are now able to achieve this finer granularity by hijacking traffic and running experiments at the gateway.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="red-teaming">Red teaming<a href="#red-teaming" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Red teaming" title="Direct link to Red teaming">​</a></h3><p>Understandably, our team members grew bored of regular chaos experiments. After all, it’s something like telling your left hand to fight against your right hand. Here at IEG, <strong>we integrate a testing practice called red teaming into chaos engineering to ensure that our system resiliency improves in an organic way.</strong> Red teaming is similar to penetration testing, but more targeted. It requires a group of testers to emulate real-world attacks from an outsider’s perspective. If I were in charge of IT operations, I would simulate faults to specific services, and check to see whether my developer colleges were doing a good job. If I found any potential faults, well, be prepared for some “hard talk.” On the other hand, developers would actively perform chaos experiments and make sure no risk was left behind to avoid being blamed.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The red teaming process in IEG" src="/assets/images/red-teaming-process-in-IEG-9c4e15b2baa0791bb078de705ec915fe.png" width="1999" height="1957" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">The red teaming process in IEG</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="dependency-analysis">Dependency analysis<a href="#dependency-analysis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dependency analysis" title="Direct link to Dependency analysis">​</a></h3><p>It’s important to manage dependencies for microservices. In our case, non-core services cannot be the bottleneck for core services. Fortunately, with chaos engineering, we can run dependency analysis simply by injecting faults into called services and observing how badly the main service is affected. Based on the results, we can optimize the service calling chain in a specific scenario.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="automated-fault-detection-and-diagnosis">Automated fault detection and diagnosis<a href="#automated-fault-detection-and-diagnosis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Automated fault detection and diagnosis" title="Direct link to Automated fault detection and diagnosis">​</a></h3><p>We are also exploring AI bots to help us detect and diagnose faults. As services become more complex, the likelihood of failure increases. <strong>Our goal is to train a fault detection model through large-scale chaos experiments in production or other controlled environments.</strong></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="chaos-engineering-empowers-devops-practices">Chaos engineering empowers DevOps practices<a href="#chaos-engineering-empowers-devops-practices" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos engineering empowers DevOps practices" title="Direct link to Chaos engineering empowers DevOps practices">​</a></h2><p>Currently, on average, more than 50 people run chaos experiments each week, running more than 150 tests, and detecting more than 100 problems in total.</p><p>Gone are the days when performing fault injection requires a handwritten script, which can be a tough thing to do for those who are unfamiliar with it. <strong>The benefits of combining chaos engineering with DevOps practices are obvious: within a few minutes, you can orchestrate various fault types by simply dragging and dropping, execute them with a single click, and monitor the results in real-time—all in one platform.</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos engineering with DevOps ensures efficient fault injection" src="/assets/images/chaos-engineering-with-devops-5f6fab8a9cb2ab88dd0915d536f5de6f.png" width="1999" height="568" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Chaos engineering with DevOps ensures efficient fault injection</p><p>Thanks to full-featured chaos engineering tools and streamlined DevOps processes, we estimate that the efficiency of fault injection and chaos-based optimization at IEG has been improved at least by 10 times in the last six months. If you were unsure about implementing chaos engineering in your business, I hope our experience can be of some help.</p>]]></content:encoded>

It is one of the Apache Software Foundation's top-level projects and serves hundreds of companies around the world, processing their mission-critical traffic, including finance, the Internet, manufacturing, retail, and operators. Our customers include NASA, the European Union's digital factory, China Mobile, and Tencent.</p><p>As our community grows, Apache APISIX's features more frequently interact with external components, making our system more complex and increasing the possibility of errors. To identify potential system failures and build confidence in the production environment, we introduced the concept of Chaos Engineering.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Apache APISIX architecture" src="/assets/images/apache-apisix-architecture-16026d6248e9c7ea47943b6105163d84.jpg" width="1080" height="510" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center"> Apache APISIX architecture </p><p>In this post, we'll share how we use <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> to improve our system stability.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="our-pain-points">Our pain points<a href="#our-pain-points" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our pain points" title="Direct link to Our pain points">​</a></h2><p>Apache APISIX processes tens of billions of requests a day. At that volume level, our users have noticed a couple of issues:</p><ul><li><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> In Apache APISIX's configuration center, when unexpectedly high network latency occurs between etcd and Apache APISIX, can Apache APISIX still filter and forward traffic normally?</li><li><strong>Scenario #2:</strong> When a node in the etcd cluster fails and the cluster can still run normally, an error is reported for the node's interaction with the Apache APISIX admin API.</li></ul><p>Although Apache APISIX has covered many scenarios through unit, end-to-end (E2E), and fuzz tests in continuous integration (CI), it has not covered the interaction scenario with external components. If the system behaves abnormally, for example, if the network jitters, a hard disk fails, or a process is killed, can Apache APISIX give appropriate error messages? Can it keep running or restore itself to normal operation?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="why-we-chose-chaos-mesh">Why we chose Chaos Mesh<a href="#why-we-chose-chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why we chose Chaos Mesh" title="Direct link to Why we chose Chaos Mesh">​</a></h2><p>To test these user scenarios and to discover similar problems before our product goes into production, our community decided to use Chaos Mesh for chaos testing.</p><p>Chaos Mesh is a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that features all-around fault injection methods for complex systems on Kubernetes, covering faults in Pod, the network, file system, and even the kernel. It helps users find weaknesses in the system and ensures that the system can resist out-of-control situations in the production environment.</p><p>Like Apache APISIX, Chaos Mesh has an active open source community. We know that an active community can ensure stable software use and rapid iteration. This makes Chaos Mesh more attractive.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="how-we-use-chaos-mesh-in-apisix">How we use Chaos Mesh in APISIX<a href="#how-we-use-chaos-mesh-in-apisix" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How we use Chaos Mesh in APISIX" title="Direct link to How we use Chaos Mesh in APISIX">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Engineering has grown beyond simple fault injection and now forms a complete methodology. To create a chaos experiment, we determined what the normal operation or "steady state" of our application should be. We then introduced potential problems to see how the system responded. If the problems knocked the application out of its steady state, we fixed them.</p><p>Now, we'll take the two scenarios we mentioned to show you how we use Chaos Mesh in Apache APISIX.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="scenario-1">Scenario #1<a href="#scenario-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scenario #1" title="Direct link to Scenario #1">​</a></h3><p>We deployed a Chaos Engineering experiment using the following steps:</p><ol><li><p>We found metrics to measure whether Apache APISIX is running normally. In the test, the most important method is to use Grafana to monitor the Apache APISIX's running metrics. We extracted data from Prometheus in CI for comparison. Here, we used the routing and forwarding requests per second (RPS) and etcd connectivity as evaluation metrics. We analyzed the log. For Apache APISIX, we checked Nginx's error log to determine whether there was an error and whether the error was in line with our expectations.</p></li><li><p>We performed a test in the control group. We found that both <code>create route</code> and <code>access route</code> were successful, and we could connect to etcd. We recorded the RPS.</p></li><li><p>We used network chaos to add a five second network latency and then retested. This time, <code>set route</code> failed, <code>get route</code> succeeded, etcd could be connected to, and RPS had no significant change compared to the previous experiment. The experiment met our expectations.</p></li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="High network latency occurs between etcd and Apache APISIX" src="/assets/images/high-network-latency-between-etcd-and-apache-apisix-9d036984f06e3f53e2f030428ccf917e.jpg" width="1080" height="1016" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center"> High network latency occurs between etcd and Apache APISIX </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="scenario-2">Scenario #2<a href="#scenario-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scenario #2" title="Direct link to Scenario #2">​</a></h3><p>After we conducted the same experiment as above in the control group, we introduced pod-kill chaos and reproduced the expected error. When we randomly deleted a small number of etcd nodes in the cluster, sometimes APISIX could connect to etcd and sometimes not, and the log printed a large number of connection rejection errors.</p><p>When we deleted the first or third node in the etcd endpoint list, the <code>set route</code> returned a result normally. However, when we deleted the second node in the list, the <code>set route</code> returned the error "connection refused."</p><p>Our troubleshooting revealed that the etcd Lua API used by Apache APISIX selected the endpoint sequentially, not randomly. Therefore, when we created an etcd client, we bound to only one etcd endpoint. This led to continuous failure.</p><p>After we fixed this problem, we added a health check to the etcd Lua API to ensure that a large number of requests would not be sent to the disconnected etcd node. To avoid flooding the log with errors, we added a fallback mechanism when the etcd cluster was completely disconnected.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Error Reported from etcd Node Interaction" src="/assets/images/error-reported-from-etcd-node-interaction-529a2e15e86ca5b3cb347db0f13a751b.jpg" width="1080" height="1149" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center"> An error is reported from one etcd node's interaction with the Apache APISIX admin API </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="our-future-plans">Our future plans<a href="#our-future-plans" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our future plans" title="Direct link to Our future plans">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="run-a-chaos-test-in-e2e-simulation-scenarios">Run a chaos test in E2E simulation scenarios<a href="#run-a-chaos-test-in-e2e-simulation-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Run a chaos test in E2E simulation scenarios" title="Direct link to Run a chaos test in E2E simulation scenarios">​</a></h3><p>In Apache APISIX, we manually identify system weaknesses for testing and repair. As in the open source community, we test in CI, so we don't need to worry about the impact of Chaos Engineering's failure radius on the production environment. But the test cannot cover complicated and comprehensive application scenarios in the production environment.</p><p>To cover more scenarios, the community plans to use the existing E2E test to simulate more complete scenarios and conduct chaos tests that are more random and cover a larger range.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="add-chaos-tests-to-more-apache-apisix-projects">Add chaos tests to more Apache APISIX projects<a href="#add-chaos-tests-to-more-apache-apisix-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Add chaos tests to more Apache APISIX projects" title="Direct link to Add chaos tests to more Apache APISIX projects">​</a></h3><p>In addition to finding more vulnerabilities for Apache APISIX, the community plans to add chaos tests to more projects such as Apache APISIX Dashboard and Apache APISIX Ingress Controller.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="add-features-to-chaos-mesh">Add features to Chaos Mesh<a href="#add-features-to-chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Add features to Chaos Mesh" title="Direct link to Add features to Chaos Mesh">​</a></h3><p>When we deployed Chaos Mesh, some features were temporarily unsupported. For example, we couldn't select a service as a network latency target or specify container port injection as network chaos. In the future, the Apache APISIX community will assist Chaos Mesh to add related features.</p><p>You're welcome to contribute to the <a href="https://github.com/apache/apisix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apache APISIX project</a> on GitHub.

            <description><![CDATA[Chaos Mesh 2.0: To a Chaos Engineering Ecology]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh 2.0: To a Chaos Engineering Ecology" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-2.0-ga-0dd019af0c94838abca9d11015cd0157.png" width="1501" height="501" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>On July 23, 2021, Chaos Mesh 2.0 was made generally available! It’s an exciting release, marking a solid milestone towards the chaos engineering ecology that we hope to build.</p><p>Making chaos engineering easier has always been Chaos Mesh’s unswerving goal, and this release is a key step. After almost a year of continuous efforts, we have made major improvements in three main areas: ease of use, native experiment orchestration &amp; scheduling, along with the richness of fault injection types.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="ease-of-use">Ease of use<a href="#ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ease of use" title="Direct link to Ease of use">​</a></h2><p>We are committed to improving the usability of Chaos Mesh, and a key path to this is Chaos Dashboard, a web interface for users to orchestrate chaos experiments. For Chaos Mesh 2.0, we have improved the Chaos Dashboard in the following ways, further simplifying the complexity of chaos experiments:</p><ul><li>It now supports the creation, viewing, and updating of AWSChaos and GCPChaos, so that conducting chaos experiments in a cloud environment can provide a consistent experience as in Kubernetes;</li><li>It can display more detailed records of each experiment, further enhancing its visibility.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh 2.0 - Experiment scheduling" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-scheduling-2.0-eb39143d5b731437e817ad869d81e2b3.png" width="1999" height="1142" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="native-experiment-orchestration--scheduling">Native experiment orchestration &amp; scheduling<a href="#native-experiment-orchestration--scheduling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Native experiment orchestration &amp; scheduling" title="Direct link to Native experiment orchestration &amp; scheduling">​</a></h2><p>When conducting chaos experiments, a single experiment is often not enough to simulate a complete testing scenario, and manually starting or stopping the experiment would be a tedious and dangerous thing to do. Previously, we <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/blog/building_automated_testing_framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">combined Argo with Chaos Mesh</a> to inject faults automatically as a workflow. However, we later realized that Argo workflow is not the best way to describe declarative chaos experiments, and decided to write another workflow engine. Chaos Mesh 2.0 features native Workflow to support experiment orchestration, which means you can serially or parallely execute multiple experiments. You can even weave in notifications and health checks to simulate more complex experimental scenarios.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh 2.0 - Workflow" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-workflow-2.0-be58bae24386d8eeb703c34ddef2ff93.png" width="1999" height="1142" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>In previous versions, we used the <code>cron</code> and <code>duration</code> fields to define chaos experiments that were executed periodically. It didn’t take us long to realize that describing behavior this way was not fitting. For example, a single execution often takes longer than an execution cycle. This definition works fine, but lacks a suitable description for the study of expected behavior. We referred to CronJob and introduced Schedule, a new custom object, to Chaos Mesh. It adds more explicit properties to periodically executed tasks, such as whether multiple experiments are allowed to be executed at the same time, thereby restricting behavior.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh 2.0 - Schedule" src="/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-schedule-2.0-2bf9d7f92e8d254bd979a28f47ae9ef9.png" width="1999" height="1142" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="richer-fault-injection-types">Richer fault injection types<a href="#richer-fault-injection-types" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Richer fault injection types" title="Direct link to Richer fault injection types">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh already supports system-level fault injection types, as well as fault injections into cloud environments such as AWSChaos and GCPChaos. Starting from 2.0, injecting chaos into the application layer has been made possible with the introduction of JVMChaos and HTTPChaos.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="jvmchaos">JVMChaos<a href="#jvmchaos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to JVMChaos" title="Direct link to JVMChaos">​</a></h3><p>JVM languages such as Java and Kotlin are widely used in the industry. A JVMChaos can be easily simulated through methods like JVM bytecode enhancement and Java Agent. Currently, JVMChaos uses <a href="https://github.com/chaosblade-io/chaosblade-exec-jvm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaosblade-exec-jvm</a>, and supports injecting various application-level fault types including method delay, specify return value, OOM and throw custom exception. For more info, you can refer to the document: <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/simulate-jvm-application-chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulate JVM Application Faults</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="httpchaos">HTTPChaos<a href="#httpchaos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to HTTPChaos" title="Direct link to HTTPChaos">​</a></h3><p>HTTPChaos is a brand new Chaos type supported in the 2.0 version. It can hijack HTTP service requests and responses from the server side, as well as interrupt links, delay injection, or modify Header/Body. It is suitable for all scenarios that use HTTP as the communication protocol. For more information, refer to <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/docs/simulate-http-chaos-on-kubernetes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simulate HTTP Faults</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="chaosd-an-fault-injection-tool-for-physical-nodes">Chaosd: an fault injection tool for physical nodes<a href="#chaosd-an-fault-injection-tool-for-physical-nodes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaosd: an fault injection tool for physical nodes" title="Direct link to Chaosd: an fault injection tool for physical nodes">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh is designed for Kubernetes. For physical machine environments, we present <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaosd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaosd</a>. It evolved from chaos-daemon, a key component in Chaos Mesh, and we have added specific chaos experiments based on the characteristics of physical machines. Currently, Chaosd supports process kill, network, JVM, pressure, disk and a few other types of fault injection onto the physical machine.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="looking-ahead">Looking ahead<a href="#looking-ahead" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking ahead" title="Direct link to Looking ahead">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh is still under active development, and we have some more powerful features in the works, including:</p><ul><li>To inject JVMChaos at runtime, lowering the cost of JVMChaos and making it more easy-to-use.</li><li>To introduce a plug-in mechanism to build custom chaos experiments, while the Scheduling function remains unimpaired.</li></ul><p>In addition, we noticed that chaos experiments can be reused in a number of scenarios, hence we plan to launch a platform, where customized experiments can be turned into templates. This will enable our users to share and reuse not only specific chaos experiments, but also Workflows for different scenarios.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="try-it-out">Try it out!<a href="#try-it-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Try it out!" title="Direct link to Try it out!">​</a></h2><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_UlAA"><div class="admonitionHeading_Kv5A"><span class="admonitionIcon__V4t"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_nNvp"><p>2022-10-24: Because of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html</a>, and refer to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/website/pull/356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#356</a>, the interactive tutorial is temporarily unavailable.</p></div></div><p>Try out the <code>Chaos Mesh 2.0 interactive scenarios</code> from your browser!

Ever since first open-sourced on GitHub on Dec 31st, 2019, it has not stopped: in July 2020, Chaos Mesh joined CNCF <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/blog/chaos-mesh-join-cncf-sandbox-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as a Sandbox project</a>; a few months later in September, Chaos Mesh 1.0 was <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/blog/chaos-mesh-1.0-chaos-engineering-on-kubernetes-made-easier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">officially released</a>. In July 2021, after a few beta versions, <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v2.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh 2.0 was announced generally available</a>!</p><p>So far, Chaos Mesh has brought out 35 releases, received 1,500+ commits from 100+ contributors, won over 3.8k+ stargazers and 420+ forks. All these achievements would not have been possible without the wonderful community.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh contributors" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-all-contributors-3ad3281e2aecb8de0c1fca8cbf591dbb.jpeg" width="2501" height="4987" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Chaos Mesh contributors (as of 2021.08.02)</p><p>Here are a few of our favourite contributions to highlight:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/YangKeao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@YangKeao</a> introduced <code>kubebuilder</code> to Chaos Mesh, an SDK for building Kubernetes APIs using CRD, which simplified the steps to implement the Controller.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/g1eny0ung" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@g1eny0ung</a> brought in the Chaos Dashboard, a Web UI for manipulating and observing chaos experiments.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Yiyiyimu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Yiyiyimu</a> contributed <code>chaosctl</code>, a tool that simplifies chaos development and debugging.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Gallardot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Gallardot</a> helped implement JVMChaos, making it possible for Chaos Mesh to simulate JVM application faults.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/STRRL" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@STRRL</a> started the work on Chaos Mesh Workflow, a built-in workflow engine which enables running different chaos experiments in a serial or parallel manner to simulate production-level errors.</li></ul><p>For those who enjoy chaos engineering and open source equally, our mission is to make sure that this is where you belong by enriching the contribution journey, and here’s where we are at so far:</p><ul><li>We published the Chaos Mesh <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Governance</a> in the beginning of 2021, making clear the roles and responsibilities of each community member as well as the decision-making process, and has since promoted 9 Committers.</li><li>We have mentored 4 mentees through the LFX mentorship programs so far.

At one of our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paIgJYOhdGw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous community meetings</a>, Sergio Méndez and Jossie Castrillo from the University of San Carlos of Guatemala shared how they used Linkerd and Chaos Mesh to conduct chaos experiments for their project, “<a href="https://github.com/sergioarmgpl/operating-systems-usac-course/blob/master/lang/en/projects/project1v3/project1.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">COVID-19 Realtime Vaccinated People Visualizer</a>”.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Project Architecture" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-linkerd-architecture-5fca7bb217df34ff1bc30abc5502bdd4.png" width="2554" height="1434" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Project Architecture</p><p><strong>Q: Can I use Chaos Mesh on-premises or do I need Amazon Web Services (AWS) or Google Cloud Platform (GCP)?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> You can do either! You can deploy Chaos Mesh on your Kubernetes cluster, so it does not matter whether you manage it yourself or have it hosted on AWS or GCP. However, if you would like to use it in a Kubernetes environment, you need to <a href="https://chaos-mesh-website-archived.netlify.app/docs/1.2.4/user_guides/installation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set relevant parameters</a> during installation.</p><p><strong>Q: How do "chaos actions" work?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Chaos Mesh uses Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) to manage chaos experiments. Different fault injection behaviors are implemented in different ways, but the overall idea is the same: Chaos Mesh uses an application's execution link to inject chaos into the application. For example, when we inject chaos into the overall link of network interaction, the network interaction card is passed through. Because Linux uses traffic control to increase interference to the specific network interaction card, we can directly use traffic control for network fault injection.</p><p><strong>Q: Are you going to add probe support to Chaos Mesh for steady state detection and experiment validation?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Currently, there is no plan to add this support. Steady state detection and experiment validation are necessary if an application is ready for production. Chaos Mesh itself does not monitor related work, but provides an interface to access existing monitoring systems or the status interface of the application to monitor and detect the application’s steady state.</p><p><strong>Q: What elevated privileges do the Chaos Mesh pods need?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> By default, the Chaos Daemon components in Chaos Mesh run in the <code>privileged</code> mode. If your Kubernetes cluster version is v3.11 or higher, you can replace <code>privileged</code> mode by configuring <code>capabilities</code>.</p><p><strong>Q: Can I implement Chaos Mesh inside build pipelines to log specific test results?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, that’s easy to do. You can integrate Chaos Mesh with pipeline systems such as Argo, Jenkins, GitHub Action, and Spanner. Chaos Mesh uses Kubernetes CRDs to manage chaos experiments. To inject chaos, you only need to create the chaos CRD object you want in the pipeline. You can obtain the running status of an experiment through its status structure and event.</p><p><strong>Q: What can we expect from the 2.0 release? Can you share some updates on HTTPChaos?</strong></p><p><strong>A:</strong> Chaos Mesh 2.0 will provide native workflow support, and users can arrange chaos experiments in Chaos Mesh. In addition, for Chaos Mesh 2.0, we have reconstructed the existing chaos controller so that users can more easily add new fault injection types. As for HTTPChaos, we’re adding network failure simulation to the HTTP application layer!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="join-the-chaos-mesh-community">Join the Chaos Mesh community<a href="#join-the-chaos-mesh-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Join the Chaos Mesh community" title="Direct link to Join the Chaos Mesh community">​</a></h2><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh and would like to help us improve it, you're welcome to join <a href="https://slack.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our Slack channel</a> or submit your pull requests or issues to our <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

You can separate each tenant and their Kubernetes resources into their own <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">namespaces</a>. Kubernetes supports multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster. These virtual clusters are called namespaces. <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Namespaces</a> are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="cluster-having-chaos-mesh">Cluster having Chaos Mesh<a href="#cluster-having-chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cluster having Chaos Mesh" title="Direct link to Cluster having Chaos Mesh">​</a></h2><p>You designed your Kubernetes cluster to have multiple tenant services. You followed the best security practices for Kubernetes: each tenant service is running in its own namespaces, users of these tenant services have appropriate access that also only for their respective namespaces, etc.</p><p>You enabled Chaos Mesh (<a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> is a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos on Kubernetes environments) on the cluster so that your tenant services can perform different chaos activities to make sure their application/system is resilient.

They are very likely to fail. Rather than wait for processes to crash, it’s better if you kill some of them to get more memory. The OOM killer stops processes by an order and tries to recover the most memory while causing the least trouble. For detailed information on this process, see <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/391222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this introduction</a> to OOM killer.</p><p>Looking at the output above, you can see that <code>node</code>, which is our application process that should never be terminated, has an <code>oom_score_adj</code> of 988. That is quite dangerous since it is the process with the highest score to get killed. But there is a simple way to stop the OOM killer from killing a specific process. When you create a Pod, it is assigned a Quality of Service (QoS) class. For detailed information, see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/quality-service-pod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Configure Quality of Service for Pods</a>.</p><p>Generally, if you create a Pod with precisely-specified resource requests, it is classified as a <code>Guaranteed</code> Pod. OOM killers do not kill containers in a <code>Guaranteed</code> Pod if there are other things to kill. These entities include non-<code>Guaranteed</code> Pods and stress-ng workers. A Pod with no resource requests is marked as <code>BestEffort</code>, and the OOM killer stops it first.</p><p>So that's all for the tour. Our suggestion is that <code>free</code> and <code>top</code> should not be used to assess memory in containers. Be careful when you assign resource limits to your Pod and select the right QoS. In the future, we’ll create a more detailed StressChaos document.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="deeper-dive-into-kubernetes-memory-management">Deeper dive into Kubernetes memory management<a href="#deeper-dive-into-kubernetes-memory-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Deeper dive into Kubernetes memory management" title="Direct link to Deeper dive into Kubernetes memory management">​</a></h2><p>Kubernetes tries to evict Pods that use too much memory (but not more memory than their limits).

Kubernetes uses this value to decide whether or not to evict your Pods.</p><p>Kubernetes periodically inspects memory usage. If a container's memory usage increases too quickly or the container cannot be evicted, the OOM killer is invoked. Kubernetes has its way of protecting its own process, so it always picks the container. When a container is killed, it may or may not be restarted, depending on your restart policy. If it is killed, when you execute <code>kubectl describe pod &lt;your pod&gt;</code> you will see it is restarted and the reason is <code>OOMKilled</code>.</p><p>Another thing worth mentioning is the kernel memory. Since <code>v1.9</code>, Kubernetes’ kernel memory support is enabled by default. It is also a feature of cgroup memory subsystems. You can limit container kernel memory usage. Unfortunately, this causes a cgroup leak on kernel versions up to <code>v4.2</code>. You can either upgrade your kernel to <code>v4.3</code> or disable it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="how-we-implement-stresschaos">How we implement StressChaos<a href="#how-we-implement-stresschaos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How we implement StressChaos" title="Direct link to How we implement StressChaos">​</a></h2><p>StressChaos is a simple way to test your container's behavior when it is low on memory. StressChaos utilizes a powerful tool named <code>stress-ng</code> to allocate memory and continue writing to the allocated memory. Because containers have memory limits and container limits are bound to a cgroup, we must find a way to run <code>stress-ng</code> in a specific cgroup. Luckily, this part is easy. With enough privileges, we can assign any process to any cgroup by writing to files in <code>/sys/fs/cgroup/</code>.</p><p>If you are interested in Chaos Mesh and would like to help us improve it, you're welcome to join our <a href="https://slack.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack channel</a> (#project-chaos-mesh)!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos engineering tools" src="/assets/images/chaos-engineering-tools-as-a-service-018f1130dab4f321b60a8eccd366c0e1.jpeg" width="3126" height="1043" class="img_eJzl"></p><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> is a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos in Kubernetes environments. With Chaos Mesh, you can test your system's resilience and robustness on Kubernetes by injecting all types of faults into Pods, network, file system, and even the kernel.</p><p>Since it was open-sourced and accepted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) as a sandbox project, Chaos Mesh has attracted contributors worldwide and helped users test their systems. Yet it still has a lot of room for improvement:</p><ul><li>It needs to improve usability. Some features are complicated to use. For example, when you apply a chaos experiment, you often have to manually check whether the experiment has started.</li><li>It is mostly for Kubernetes environments. Because Chaos Mesh can't manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, you need to deploy Chaos Mesh for each Kubernetes cluster. Though <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaosd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaosd</a> supports running chaos experiments on physical machines, the features are quite limited, and command line usage is not user friendly.</li><li>It doesn't allow plugins. To apply a customized chaos experiment, you have to alter the source code. Moreover, Chaos Mesh only supports Golang.</li></ul><p>Admittedly, Chaos Mesh is a first-rate Chaos Engineering platform, but is still a long way from offering Chaos as a Service (CaaS). Therefore, at <a href="https://pingcap.com/community-activity/tidb-hackathon-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB Hackathon 2020</a>, <strong>we made changes to Chaos Mesh's architecture, moving it one step closer toward CaaS</strong>.</p><p>In this article, I'll talk about what CaaS is, how we achieve it with Chaos Mesh, and our plans and lessons learned. I hope you find our experience helpful in building your own Chaos Engineering system.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="what-is-chaos-as-a-service">What is Chaos as a Service?<a href="#what-is-chaos-as-a-service" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is Chaos as a Service?" title="Direct link to What is Chaos as a Service?">​</a></h2><p>As Matt Fornaciari, co-founder of Gremlin, <a href="https://jaxenter.com/chaos-engineering-service-144113.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">puts it</a>, CaaS "means you will get an intuitive UI, customer support, out-of-the-box integrations, and everything else you need to get experimenting in a matter of minutes."</p><p>From our perspective, CaaS should offer:</p><ul><li>A unified console for management, where you can edit the configuration and create chaos experiments.</li><li>Visualized metrics for you to see the experiment status.</li><li>Operations to pause or archive experiments.</li><li>Simple interaction. You can easily drag and drop the objects to orchestrate your experiments.</li></ul><p>Some companies already adapted Chaos Mesh to meet their own needs, such as <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/how-a-top-game-company-uses-chaos-engineering-to-improve-testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase Fuxi AI Lab</a> and FreeWheel, making it a mock-up for CaaS.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="developing-chaos-mesh-towards-caas">Developing Chaos Mesh towards CaaS<a href="#developing-chaos-mesh-towards-caas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Developing Chaos Mesh towards CaaS" title="Direct link to Developing Chaos Mesh towards CaaS">​</a></h2><p>Based on our understanding of CaaS, we refined the architecture of Chaos Mesh during Hackathon, including improved support for different systems and better observability. You can check out our code in <a href="https://github.com/wuntun/chaos-mesh/tree/caas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wuntun/chaos-mesh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wuntun/chaosd/tree/caas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wuntun/chaosd</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="refactor-chaos-dashboard">Refactor Chaos Dashboard<a href="#refactor-chaos-dashboard" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Refactor Chaos Dashboard" title="Direct link to Refactor Chaos Dashboard">​</a></h3><p>The current Chaos Mesh architecture is suited for individual Kubernetes clusters. Chaos Dashboard, the web UI, is bound to a specified Kubernetes environment:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh architecture" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-remake-architecture-11dd1c3b15d9508739904ec7571972fb.jpeg" width="1635" height="739" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">The current Chaos Mesh architecture</p><p>During this refactor, <strong>to allow Chaos Dashboard to manage multiple Kubernetes clusters, we separate Chaos Dashboard from the main architecture</strong>. Now, if you deploy Chaos Dashboard outside of the Kubernetes cluster, you can add the cluster to Chaos Dashboard via the web UI. If you deploy Chaos Dashboard inside the cluster, it automatically obtains the cluster information through environment variables.</p><p>You can register Chaos Mesh (technically, the Kubernetes configuration) in Chaos Dashboard or ask <code>chaos-controller-manager</code> to report to Chaos Dashboard via configuration. Chaos Dashboard and <code>chaos-controller-manager</code> interact via CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs). When <code>chaos-controller-manager</code> finds a Chaos Mesh CRD event, it invokes <code>chaos-daemon</code> to carry out the related chaos experiment. Therefore, Chaos Dashboard can manage experiments by operating on CRDs.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="refactor-chaosd">Refactor chaosd<a href="#refactor-chaosd" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Refactor chaosd" title="Direct link to Refactor chaosd">​</a></h3><p>chaosd is a toolkit for running chaos experiments on physical machines. Previously, it was only a command line tool and had limited features.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="chaosd, a Chaos Engineering command line tool" src="/assets/images/chaosd-chaos-engineering-command-line-tool-b516d67d95f896a548a90492e516e870.jpeg" width="1331" height="561" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Previously, chaosd was a command line tool</p><p>During the refactoring, <strong>we enabled chaosd to support the RESTful API and enhanced its services so that it can configure chaos experiments by parsing CRD-format JSON or YAML files</strong>.</p><p>Now, chaosd can register itself to Chaos Dashboard via configuration and send regular heartbeats to Chaos Dashboard. With the heartbeat signals, Chaos Dashboard can manage the chaosd node status. You can also add chaosd nodes to Chaos Dashboard via the web UI.</p><p>Moreover, <strong>chaosd can now schedule chaos experiments at specified time and manage experiment lifecycles, which unifies the user experience on Kubernetes and on physical machines</strong>.</p><p>With new Chaos Dashboard and chaosd, the optimized architecture of Chaos Mesh is as follows:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh&amp;#39;s optimized architecture" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-optimized-architecture-8887bf8ec188ff72990a48dd1b2735f8.jpeg" width="1482" height="824" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">Chaos Mesh's optimized architecture</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="improve-observability">Improve observability<a href="#improve-observability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Improve observability" title="Direct link to Improve observability">​</a></h3><p>Another improvement is observability, namely how to tell if an experiment is carried out successfully.</p><p>Before the improvement, you had to manually check the experiment metrics. If you injected <a href="https://chaos-mesh-website-archived.netlify.app/docs/1.2.4/chaos_experiments/stresschaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StressChaos</a> into a Pod, you had to enter the Pod to see if there was a <code>stress-ng</code> process and then use <code>top</code> commands to check CPU and memory utilization. These metrics told you whether your StressChaos experiment was created successfully.</p><p>To streamline the process, we now integrate <code>node_exporter</code> into <code>chaos-daemon</code> and chaosd to collect node metrics. We also deploy <code>kube-state-metrics</code> in the Kubernetes cluster, combined with cadvisor, to collect Kubernetes metrics. The collected metrics are saved and visualized by Prometheus and Grafana, which provide a simple method for you to check the experiment status.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="further-improvements-needed">Further improvements needed<a href="#further-improvements-needed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Further improvements needed" title="Direct link to Further improvements needed">​</a></h4><p>Overall, metrics aim to help you:</p><ul><li>Confirm that chaos is injected.</li><li>Observe the chaos impact on the service and make periodic analysis.</li><li>Respond to exceptional chaos events.</li></ul><p>To achieve these goals, the system needs to monitor the experiment data metrics, the ordinary metrics, and the experiment events. Chaos Mesh still needs to improve:</p><ul><li>Experiment data metrics, such as the exact latency duration of the injected network latency and the specific load of the simulated workload.</li><li>Experiment events; that is, the Kubernetes events of creating, deleting, and running experiments.</li></ul><p>Here is a good example of metrics from <a href="https://github.com/litmuschaos/chaos-exporter#example-metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Litmus</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="other-proposals-for-chaos-mesh">Other proposals for Chaos Mesh<a href="#other-proposals-for-chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other proposals for Chaos Mesh" title="Direct link to Other proposals for Chaos Mesh">​</a></h2><p>Because of the limited time at Hackathon, we didn't finish all our plans. Here are some of our proposals for the Chaos Mesh community to consider in the future.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="orchestration">Orchestration<a href="#orchestration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Orchestration" title="Direct link to Orchestration">​</a></h3><p>A closed loop of Chaos Engineering includes four steps: exploring chaos, discovering deficiencies in the system, analyzing root causes, and sending feedback for improvement.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="A closed loop of Chaos Engineering" src="/assets/images/closed-loop-of-chaos-engineering-3dc83a5a0d542f1cb6a873130b48bd22.jpeg" width="1338" height="484" class="img_eJzl"></p><p class="caption-center">A closed loop of Chaos Engineering</p><p>However, <strong>most of the current open source Chaos Engineering tools only focus on exploration and do not provide pragmatic feedback.</strong> Based on the improved observability component, we can monitor chaos experiments in real time and compare and analyze the experiment results.</p><p>With these results, we will be able to realize a closed loop by adding another important component: orchestration. The Chaos Mesh community already proposed a <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/rfcs/pull/10/files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workflow</a> feature, which enables you to easily orchestrate and call back chaos experiments or conveniently integrate Chaos Mesh with other systems. You can run chaos experiments in the CI/CD phase or after a canary release.</p><p><strong>Combining observability and orchestration makes a closed feedback loop for Chaos Engineering.</strong> If you were to launch a 100 ms network latency test on a Pod, you could observe the latency change using the observability component and check if the Pod service is still available using PromQL or other DSL based on orchestration. If the service was unavailable, you may conclude that the service is unavailable when the latency is &gt;= 100 ms.</p><p>But 100 ms is not the threshold of your service; you need to know what is the largest latency your service can handle. By orchestrating the value of the chaos experiment, you'll know what is the threshold value you must ensure to meet your service-level objectives. Also, you'll find out the service performance under different network conditions and whether they meet your expectations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="data-format">Data format<a href="#data-format" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data format" title="Direct link to Data format">​</a></h3><p>Chaos Mesh uses CRDs to define its chaos objects. If we can convert CRDs to JSON files, we can achieve communication between components.</p><p>In terms of data format, chaosd just consumes and registers CRD data in JSON format. If a chaos tool can consume CRD data and register itself, it can run chaos experiments in different scenarios.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="plugins">Plugins<a href="#plugins" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Plugins" title="Direct link to Plugins">​</a></h3><p>Chaos Mesh has limited support for plugins. You can only <a href="https://chaos-mesh-website-archived.netlify.app/docs/1.2.4/development_guides/develop_a_new_chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">add a new Chaos</a> by registering a CRD in Kubernetes API. This brings about two problems:</p><ul><li>You must develop the plugin using Golang, the same language in which Chaos Mesh is written.</li><li>You must merge the extended code into the Chaos Mesh project. Because Chaos Mesh doesn't have a security mechanism like Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF), merging plugin code may introduce extra risks.</li></ul><p>To enable full plugin support, we need to explore a new method to add plugins. As Chaos Mesh essentially carries out chaos experiments based on CRD, a chaos experiment only requires generating, listening to, and deleting CRDs. In this regard, we have several ideas worth trying:</p><ul><li>Develop a controller or operator to manage CRDs.</li><li>Handle CRD events uniformly and operate on CRDs via HTTP callback. This method only uses HTTP APIs, with no requirement on Golang. For an example, see <a href="https://github.com/summerwind/whitebox-controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitebox Controller</a>.</li><li>Use WebAssembly (Wasm). When you need to call chaos experiment logic, just call the Wasm program.</li><li>Use SQL to query the chaos experiment status. Because Chaos Mesh is based on CRDs, you can use SQL to operate on Kubernetes. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/xuxinkun/kubesql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Presto connector</a> and <a href="https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">osquery extension</a>.</li><li>Use SDK-based extensions, such as <a href="https://docs.chaostoolkit.org/reference/api/experiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Toolkit</a>.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="integration-with-other-chaos-tools">Integration with other Chaos tools<a href="#integration-with-other-chaos-tools" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Integration with other Chaos tools" title="Direct link to Integration with other Chaos tools">​</a></h3><p>For real-world systems, a single Chaos Engineering tool can hardly exhaust all possible use cases. That's why integrating with other chaos tools can make the Chaos Engineering ecosystem more powerful.</p><p>There are numerous Chaos Engineering tools on the market. Litmus's <a href="https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-go/tree/master/chaoslib/powerfulseal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes implementation</a> is based on <a href="https://github.com/powerfulseal/powerfulseal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PowerfulSeal</a>, while its <a href="https://github.com/litmuschaos/litmus-go/tree/master/chaoslib/pumba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">container implementation</a> is based on <a href="https://github.com/alexei-led/pumba" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pumba</a>. <a href="https://github.com/cloud-bulldozer/kraken" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kraken</a> focuses on Kubernetes, <a href="https://github.com/amzn/awsssmchaosrunner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWSSSMChaosRunner</a> focuses on AWS, and <a href="https://github.com/shopify/toxiproxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toxiproxy</a> targets TCP. There are also merging projects based on <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gMlmXqH6ufnb8eNO10WqVjqrPRGAO5-1S1zjcGo1Zr4/edit#slide=id.g58453c664c_2_75" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Envoy</a> and Istio.</p><p>To manage the various chaos tools, we may need a uniform pattern, such as <a href="https://hub.litmuschaos.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Hub</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="voices-from-the-community">Voices from the community<a href="#voices-from-the-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Voices from the community" title="Direct link to Voices from the community">​</a></h2><p>Here, we'd like to share how a leading cyber security company in China as well as a Chaos Mesh user, adapts Chaos Mesh to meet their needs. Their adaptation has three aspects: physical node, container, and application.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="physical-node">Physical node<a href="#physical-node" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Physical node" title="Direct link to Physical node">​</a></h3><ul><li>Support executing scripts on physical servers. You can configure the script directory in CRDs and run your scripts using <code>chaos-daemon</code>.</li><li>Simulate reboot, shutdown, and kernel panic using the customized script.</li><li>Shut down the node's NIC using the customized script.</li><li>Create frequent context switching using sysbench to simulate the "noisy neighbor" effect.</li><li>Intercept the container's system call using BPF's <code>seccomp</code>. This is achieved by passing and filtering PIDs.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="container">Container<a href="#container" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Container" title="Direct link to Container">​</a></h3><ul><li>Randomly change the number of Deployment replicas to test if the application's traffic is abnormal.</li><li>Embed based on CRD objects: fill Ingress objects in chaos CRDs to simulate the speed limit of the interface.</li><li>Embed based on CRD objects: fill Cilium network policy objects in chaos CRDs to simulate fluctuating network conditions.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="application">Application<a href="#application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Application" title="Direct link to Application">​</a></h3><ul><li>Support running customized jobs. Currently, Chaos Mesh injects chaos using <code>chaos-daemon</code>, which doesn't guarantee fairness and affinity of scheduling. To address this issue, we can use <code>chaos-controller-manager</code> to directly create jobs for different CRDs.</li><li>Support running <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/newman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newman</a> in customized jobs to randomly change HTTP parameters. This is to implement chaos experiments on the HTTP interface, which happens when a user performs exceptional behaviors.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="summary">Summary<a href="#summary" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Summary" title="Direct link to Summary">​</a></h2><p>Traditional fault testing targets specific points in the system that are anticipated to be vulnerable. It is often an assertion: a specific condition produces a specific result.</p><p><strong>Chaos Engineering is more powerful in that it helps you discover the "unknown unknowns."</strong> By exploring in the broader domain, Chaos Engineering deepens your knowledge of the system being tested and unearths new information.</p><p>To sum up, these are some of our personal thoughts and practice on Chaos Engineering and Chaos Mesh. Our Hackathon project is not ready for production yet, but we hope to shed some light on CaaS and draft a promising roadmap for Chaos Mesh.

For someone who started to code only because I was fascinated by it, it was all a journey of self-learning, filled with various adversities. But when I started with open-source contributions, it was all very beginner-friendly and I came across a lot of people who helped me learn the tech stack better.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="img1" src="/assets/images/mentroship_blog1-e96abe255f46c1dab61e7662a5a04e0e.png" width="353" height="419" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="the-journey-through-the-application">The journey through the application<a href="#the-journey-through-the-application" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The journey through the application" title="Direct link to The journey through the application">​</a></h2><p>In the spring of 2021, I got to know about this LFX mentorship program and after browsing through all the <a href="https://github.com/cncf/mentoring/blob/master/lfx-mentorship/2021/01-Spring/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">projects</a>, it felt quite intimidating to me as I wasn’t acquainted with most of the terms and was confused, and I thought it was not for newbies like me. Then I went through the program <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">docs</a>, the mentorship <a href="https://docs.linuxfoundation.org/lfx/mentorship/mentorship-faqs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ’s</a> followed the steps mentioned there and applied for a few projects that interested me, and used tech-stacks that I am familiar with, like Docker, AWS, Python, etc.</p><p>Then I applied to both projects offered by <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> and submitted my CV and cover letter as immediate tasks.

I was elated, as it was my first involvement in any open-source program. I was glad to be accepted as a mentee in the program, I even received an email from CNCF regarding my selection.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="img3" src="/assets/images/mentorship_blog4-c9f0e57401ea29be852f9f62f8aba238.png" width="687" height="772" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Along with my mentor, we decided on our mode of communication: through Slack. He also enquired about my knowledge of Kubernetes and GOlang, as I didn’t have much knowledge about either of them. He suggested a few resources and gave me 2 weeks to go through them. In the meantime, he also planned a few experiments for me to get acquainted with all these technologies.</p><p>As I was getting more comfortable with Kubernetes, I started exploring Chaos Mesh and completed the <code>interactive tutorial</code>, which gave me a clearer idea about the usage of Chaos Mesh. I then implemented the <a href="https://chaos-mesh-website-archived.netlify.app/docs/1.2.4/development_guides/develop_a_new_chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hello-world chaos</a>, which helped me to know more about controllers and CRDs, considered to be the most important part of Chaos Mesh. Also, I got to know about the boilerplate codes, the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kube-builder client</a>, and how to use them for scaffolding, followed by writing our own controllers.</p><p>After the initial days of experimenting and getting to know the project better, I started with solving a few good first issues to get acquainted with upstream contributions to Chaos Mesh.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="img4" src="/assets/images/mentorship_blog3-7e4fd166523fb553e3c254d2ba1390ae.png" width="1208" height="156" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>In one of my contributions, I tried to add multi-container support to stress-chaos, which was not possible before. Though it was successfully implemented, it broke a few other features and couldn’t be merged for the upcoming release. What’s more, for the 2.0.0 release, this refactoring was already done, so this particular contribution was a learning experience for both me and my mentor. After that, we became careful and the next time we tried to implement any new features, we would first submit an <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/rfcs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RFC</a> and have discussions with the other contributors before starting.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="my-contribution-to-aws-chaos">My contribution to AWS Chaos<a href="#my-contribution-to-aws-chaos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to My contribution to AWS Chaos" title="Direct link to My contribution to AWS Chaos">​</a></h2><p>Initially, I was asked to implement one type of AWS Chaos as part of this project, but as I started exploring more about it, I found <a href="https://github.com/amzn/awsssmchaosrunner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">awsssmchaosrunner</a>, and given its functionality, we wanted to integrate it into Chaos Mesh.</p><p>We planned to do it in two parts, one part is the “<a href="https://github.com/STRRL/awsssmchaosrunner-cli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">runner thing</a>” project, which integrates with awsssmchaosrunner, that part should be written in kotlin, and a docker image is to be built out of it.</p><p>Another part is the definition of the AWS Chaos and its <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/1919" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controller</a>, which is to be written in go, the controller of AWS Chaos will create a pod with that “kotlin cli image”, and send commands to AWS.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="other-opportunities">Other opportunities<a href="#other-opportunities" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Other opportunities" title="Direct link to Other opportunities">​</a></h2><p>I was invited to one of the Chaos Mesh <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElG0pHRoXwI&amp;t=2s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community meetings</a> towards the end of the mentorship where I showcased my project.</p><p>Afterwards, I applied for the CFP for <a href="https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-kcd-bengaluru-presents-kubernetes-community-days-bengaluru/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes Community Days Bangalore</a>, scheduled virtually from June 25–26, 2021, and was selected as a speaker and now I’m all set to present my talk there.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="graduation-and-next-steps">Graduation and Next steps<a href="#graduation-and-next-steps" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Graduation and Next steps" title="Direct link to Graduation and Next steps">​</a></h2><p>Yayyyy!!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Celebrating One Year of Chaos Mesh: Looking Back and Ahead" src="/assets/images/celebrating-one-year-of-chaos-mesh-looking-back-and-ahead-225fa7cb90dbea594d278bd75a6cbcba.jpg" width="3126" height="1042" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>It’s been a year since Chaos Mesh was first open-sourced on GitHub. Chaos Mesh started out as a mere fault injection tool and is now heading towards the goal of building a chaos engineering ecology. Meanwhile, the Chaos Mesh community was also built from scratch and has helped <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> join CNCF as a Sandbox project.</p><p>In this article, we will share with you how Chaos Mesh has grown and changed in the past year, and also discuss its future goals and plans.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="the-project-thrive-with-a-clear-goal-in-mind">The project: thrive with a clear goal in mind<a href="#the-project-thrive-with-a-clear-goal-in-mind" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The project: thrive with a clear goal in mind" title="Direct link to The project: thrive with a clear goal in mind">​</a></h2><p>In this past year, Chaos Mesh has grown at an impressive speed with the joint efforts of the community. From the very first version to the recently released <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/releases/tag/v1.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">v1.1.0</a>, Chaos Mesh has been greatly improved in terms of functionality, ease of use, and security.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="functionality">Functionality<a href="#functionality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Functionality" title="Direct link to Functionality">​</a></h3><p>When first open-sourced, Chaos Mesh supported only three fault types: PodChaos, NetworkChaos, and IOChaos. Within only a year, Chaos Mesh can perform all around fault injections into the network, system clock, JVM applications, filesystems, operating systems, and so on.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Tests" src="/assets/images/chaos-tests-53935636ee4f2a84eed8ae3e1c170ac0.png" width="904" height="256" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>After continuous optimization, Chaos Mesh now provides a flexible scheduling mechanism, which enables users to better design their own chaos experiments. This laid the foundation for chaos orchestration.</p><p>In the meantime, we are happy to see that a number of users have started to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/issues/1182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">test Chaos Mesh on major cloud platforms</a>, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Alibaba Cloud, and Tencent Cloud. We have continuously conducted compatibility testing and adaptations, in order to support <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/pull/1330" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fault injection for specific cloud platforms</a>.</p><p>To better support Kubernetes native components and node-level failures, we developed <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaosd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaosd</a>, which provides physical node-level fault injection. We're extensively testing and refining this feature for release within the next few months.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="ease-of-use">Ease of use<a href="#ease-of-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ease of use" title="Direct link to Ease of use">​</a></h3><p>Ease of use has been one of the guiding principles of Chaos Mesh development since day one. You can deploy Chaos Mesh with a single command line. The V1.0 release brought the long-awaited Chaos Dashboard, a one-stop web interface for users to orchestrate chaos experiments. You can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface with only a few clicks.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="/assets/images/chaos-dashboard1-f75f13ed59046d4d19717a1dc6900057.png" width="952" height="532" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Prior to V1.0, many users reported being blocked by various configuration problems when injecting IOChaos faults. After intense investigations and discussions, we gave up the original SideCar implementation. Instead, we used chaos-daemon to dynamically invade the target Pod, which significantly simplifies the logic. This optimization has made dynamic I/O fault injection possible with Chaos Mesh, and users can focus solely on their experiments without having to worry about additional configurations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="security">Security<a href="#security" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Security" title="Direct link to Security">​</a></h3><p>We have improved the security of Chaos Mesh. It now provides a comprehensive set of selectors to control the scope of the experiments, and supports setting specific namespaces to protect important applications. What’s more, the support of namespace permissions allows users to limit the “explosion radius” of a chaos experiment to a specific namespace.</p><p>In addition, Chaos Mesh directly reuses Kubernetes’ native permission mechanism and supports verification on the Chaos Dashboard. This protects you from other users’ errors, which can cause chaos experiments to fail or become uncontrollable.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="cloud-native-ecosystem-integrations-and-cooperations">Cloud native ecosystem: integrations and cooperations<a href="#cloud-native-ecosystem-integrations-and-cooperations" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Cloud native ecosystem: integrations and cooperations" title="Direct link to Cloud native ecosystem: integrations and cooperations">​</a></h2><p>In July 2020, Chaos Mesh was successfully <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/blog/chaos-mesh-join-cncf-sandbox-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accepted as a CNCF Sandbox project</a>. This shows that Chaos Mesh has received initial recognition from the cloud native community. At the same time, it means that Chaos Mesh has a clear mission: to promote the application of chaos engineering in the cloud native field and to cooperate with other cloud native projects so we can grow together.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="grafana">Grafana<a href="#grafana" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grafana" title="Direct link to Grafana">​</a></h3><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, we have included a separate <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh-datasource" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana plug-in</a> for Chaos Mesh, which allows users to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on the application monitoring panel. This way, users can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="github-action">GitHub Action<a href="#github-action" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to GitHub Action" title="Direct link to GitHub Action">​</a></h3><p>To enable users to run chaos experiments even during the development phase, we developed the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaos-mesh-action</a> project, allowing Chaos Mesh to run in the workflow of GitHub Actions. This way, Chaos Mesh can easily be integrated into daily system development and testing.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="tipocket">TiPocket<a href="#tipocket" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TiPocket" title="Direct link to TiPocket">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a> is an automated test platform that integrates Chaos Mesh and Argo, a workflow engine designed for Kubernetes. TiPocket is designed to be a fully automated chaos engineering testing loop for TiDB, a distributed database. There are a number of steps when we conduct chaos experiments, including deploying applications, running workloads, injecting exceptions, and business checks. To fully automate these steps, Argo was integrated into TiPocket. Chaos Mesh provides rich fault injection, while Argo provides flexible orchestration and scheduling.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TiPocket" src="/assets/images/tipocket-b6c945ab26ef1437be6a383d95019f50.png" width="904" height="420" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="the-community-built-from-the-ground-up">The community: built from the ground up<a href="#the-community-built-from-the-ground-up" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The community: built from the ground up" title="Direct link to The community: built from the ground up">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh is a community-driven project, and cannot progress without an active, friendly, and open community. Since it was open-sourced, Chaos Mesh has quickly become one of the most eye-catching open-source projects in the chaos engineering world. Within a year, it has accumulated more than 3k stars on GitHub and 70+ contributors. Adopters include Tencent Cloud, XPeng Motors, Dailymotion, NetEase Fuxi Lab, JuiceFS, APISIX, and Meituan. Looking back on the past year, the Chaos Mesh community was built from scratch, and has laid the foundation for a transparent, open, friendly, and autonomous open source community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="becoming-part-of-the-cncf-family">Becoming part of the CNCF family<a href="#becoming-part-of-the-cncf-family" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Becoming part of the CNCF family" title="Direct link to Becoming part of the CNCF family">​</a></h3><p>Cloud native has been in the DNA of Chaos Mesh since the very beginning. Joining CNCF was a natural choice, which marks a critical step for Chaos Mesh to becoming a vendor-neutral, open and transparent open-source community. Aside from integration within the cloud native ecosystem, joining CNCF gives Chaos Mesh:</p><ul><li><p>More community and project exposure. Collaborations with other projects and various cloud native community activities such as Kubernetes Meetup and KubeCon have presented us great opportunities to communicate with the community. We are amazed how the high-quality content produced by the community has also played a positive and far-reaching role in promoting Chaos Mesh.</p></li><li><p>A more complete and open community framework. CNCF provides a rather mature framework for open-source community operations. Under CNCF’s guidance, we established our basic community framework, including a Code of Conduct, Contributing Guide, and Roadmap. We’ve also created our own channel, #project-chaos-mesh, under CNCF’s Slack.</p></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="a-friendly-and-supportive-community">A friendly and supportive community<a href="#a-friendly-and-supportive-community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A friendly and supportive community" title="Direct link to A friendly and supportive community">​</a></h3><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_UlAA"><div class="admonitionHeading_Kv5A"><span class="admonitionIcon__V4t"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_nNvp"><p>2022-10-24: Because of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html</a>, and refer to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/website/pull/356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#356</a>, the interactive tutorial is temporarily unavailable.</p></div></div><p>The quality of the open source community determines whether our adopters and contributors are willing to stick around and get involved in the community for the long run.

All are constantly updated per each release.</p></li><li><p>Working with the community to publish blog posts, tutorials, use cases, and chaos engineering practices. So far, we’ve produced 26 Chaos Mesh related articles. Among them is <code>an interactive tutorial</code>, published on O’Reilly’s Katakoda site. These materials make a great complement to the documentation.</p></li><li><p>Repurposing and amplifying videos and tutorials generated in community meetings, webinars, and meetups.

Liz Rice, CNCF TOC Chair, shared <a href="https://twitter.com/CloudNativeFdn/status/1329863326428499971" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The 5 technologies to watch in 2021</a>, and chaos engineering is on top of the list. We boldly predict that chaos engineering is about to enter a new stage in the near future. Chaos Mesh 2.0 is now in active development, and it includes community requirements such as an embedded workflow engine to support the definition and management of more flexible chaos scenarios, application state checking mechanisms, and more detailed experiments reports. Follow along through the project <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/blob/master/ROADMAP.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="last-but-not-least">Last but not least<a href="#last-but-not-least" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Last but not least" title="Direct link to Last but not least">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh has grown so much in the past year, yet it is still young, and we have just set sail towards our goal.

As a Chaos Engineering platform, Chaos Mesh has supported simulating I/O faults in a filesystem ever since its early versions. By simply adding an IOChaos CustomResourceDefinition (CRD), we can watch how the filesystem fails and returns errors.</p><p>However, before Chaos Mesh 1.0, this experiment was not easy and may have consumed a lot of resources. We needed to inject sidecar containers to the Pod through the mutating admission webhooks and rewrite the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code> command. Even if no fault was injected, the injected sidecar container caused a substantial amount of overhead.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 has changed all this. Now, we can use IOChaos to inject faults to a filesystem at runtime. This simplifies the process and greatly reduces system overhead. This blog post introduces how we implement the IOChaos experiment without using a sidecar.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="io-fault-injection">I/O fault injection<a href="#io-fault-injection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to I/O fault injection" title="Direct link to I/O fault injection">​</a></h2><p>To simulate I/O faults at runtime, we need to inject faults into a filesystem after the program starts <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/syscall.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">system calls</a> (such as reads and writes) but before the call requests arrive at the target filesystem. We can do that in one of two ways:</p><ul><li>Use Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF); however, it <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/issues/2336" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cannot be used to inject delay</a>.</li><li>Add a filesystem layer called ChaosFS before the target filesystem. ChaosFS uses the target filesystem as the backend and receives requests from the operating system. The entire call link is <strong>target program syscall</strong> -&gt; <strong>Linux kernel</strong> -&gt; <strong>ChaosFS</strong> -&gt; <strong>target filesystem</strong>. Because ChaosFS is customizable, we can inject delays and errors as we want. Therefore, ChaosFS is our choice.</li></ul><p>But ChaosFS has several problems:</p><ul><li>If ChaosFS reads and writes files in the target filesystem, we need to <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mount.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount</a> ChaosFS to a different path than the target path specified in the Pod configuration. ChaosFS <strong>cannot</strong> be mounted to the path of the target directory.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS <strong>before</strong> the target program starts running. This is because the newly-mounted ChaosFS takes effect only on files that are newly opened by the program in the target filesystem.</li><li>We need to mount ChaosFS to the target containter's <code>mnt</code> namespace. For details, see <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/mount_namespaces.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount_namespaces(7) — Linux manual page</a>.</li></ul><p>Before Chaos Mesh 1.0, we used the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mutating admission webhook</a> to implement IOChaos. This technique addressed the three problems lists above and allowed us to:</p><ul><li>Run scripts in the target container. This action changed the target directory of the ChaosFS's backend filesystem (for example, from <code>/mnt/a</code> to <code>/mnt/a_bak</code>) so that we could mount ChaosFS to the target path (<code>/mnt/a</code>). Modify the command that starts the Pod. For example, we could modify the original command <code>/app</code> to <code>/waitfs.sh /app</code>.</li><li>The <code>waitfs.sh</code> script kept checking whether the filesystem was successfully mounted. If it was mounted, <code>/app</code> was started.</li><li>Add a new container in the Pod to run ChaosFS. This container needed to share a volume with the target container (for example, <code>/mnt</code>), and then we mounted this volume to the target directory (for example, <code>/mnt/a</code>). We also properly enabled <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#mount-propagation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mount propagation</a> for this volume's mount to penetrate the share to host and then penetrate slave to the target.</li></ul><p>These three approaches allowed us to inject I/O faults while the program was running. However, the injection was far from convenient:</p><ul><li>We could only inject faults into a volume subdirectory, not into the entire volume. The workaround was to replace <code>mv</code> (rename) with <code>mount move</code> to move the mount point of the target volume.</li><li>We had to explicitly write commands in the Pod rather than implicitly use the image commands. Otherwise, the <code>/waitfs.sh</code> script could not properly start the program after the filesystem was mounted.</li><li>The corresponding container needed to have a proper configuration for mount propagation. Due to potential privacy and security issues, we <strong>could not</strong> modify the configuration via the mutating admission webhook.</li><li>The injection configuration was troublesome. Worse still, we had to create a new Pod after the configuration was able to inject faults.</li><li>We could not withdraw ChaosFS while the program was running. Even if no fault or error was injected, the performance was greatly affected.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="inject-io-faults-without-the-mutating-admission-webhook">Inject I/O faults without the mutating admission webhook<a href="#inject-io-faults-without-the-mutating-admission-webhook" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Inject I/O faults without the mutating admission webhook" title="Direct link to Inject I/O faults without the mutating admission webhook">​</a></h2><p>What about cracking these tough nuts without the mutating admission webhook? Let's get back and think a bit about the reason why we used the mutating admission webhook to add a container in which ChaosFS runs. We do that to mount the filesystem to the target container.</p><p>In fact, there is another solution. Instead of adding containers to the Pod, we can first use the <code>setns</code> Linux system call to modify the namespace of the current process and then use the <code>mount</code> call to mount ChaosFS to the target container. Suppose that the filesystem to inject is <code>/mnt</code>. The new injection process is as follows:</p><ol><li>Use <code>setns</code> for the current process to enter the mnt namespace of the target container.</li><li>Execute <code>mount --move</code> to move <code>/mnt</code> to <code>/mnt_bak</code>.</li><li>Mount ChaosFS to <code>/mnt</code> and use <code>/mnt_bak</code> as the backend.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, the target container will open, read, and write the files in <code>/mnt</code> through ChaosFS. In this way, delays or faults are injected much more easily. However, there are still two questions to answer:</p><ul><li>How do you handle the files that are already opened by the target process?</li><li>How do you recover the process given that we cannot unmount the filesystem when files are opened?</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="dynamically-replace-file-descriptors">Dynamically replace file descriptors<a href="#dynamically-replace-file-descriptors" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dynamically replace file descriptors" title="Direct link to Dynamically replace file descriptors">​</a></h3><p><strong>ptrace solves both of the two questions above.</strong> We can use ptrace to replace the opened file descriptors (FD) at runtime and replace the current working directory (CWD) and mmap.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="use-ptrace-to-allow-a-tracee-to-run-a-binary-program">Use ptrace to allow a tracee to run a binary program<a href="#use-ptrace-to-allow-a-tracee-to-run-a-binary-program" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Use ptrace to allow a tracee to run a binary program" title="Direct link to Use ptrace to allow a tracee to run a binary program">​</a></h4><p><a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ptrace.2.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ptrace</a> is a powerful tool that makes the target process (tracee) to run any system call or binary program. For a tracee to run the program, ptrace modifies the RIP-pointed address to the target process and adds an <code>int3</code> instruction to trigger a breakpoint. When the binary program stops, we need to restore the registers and memory.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_assembly_language" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">x86_64 architecture</a>, the RIP register (also called an instruction pointer) always points to the memory address at which the next directive is run. To load the program into the target process memory spaces:</p></blockquote><ol><li>Use ptrace to call mmap in the target program to allocate the needed memory.</li><li>Write the binary program to the newly allocated memory and make the RIP register point to it.</li><li>After the binary program stops, call munmap to clean up the memory section.</li></ol><p>As a best practice, we often replace ptrace <code>POKE_TEXT</code> writes with <code>process_vm_writev</code> because if there is a huge amount of data to write, <code>process_vm_writev</code> performs more efficiently.</p><p>Using ptrace, we are able to make a process to replace its own FD. Now we only need a method to make that replacement happen. This method is the <code>dup2</code> system call.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor">Use <code>dup2</code> to replace file descriptor<a href="#use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor" title="Direct link to use-dup2-to-replace-file-descriptor">​</a></h4><p>The signature of the <code>dup2</code> function is <code>int dup2(int oldfd, int newfd);</code>. It is used to create a copy of the old FD (<code>oldfd</code>). This copy has an FD number of <code>newfd</code>. If <code>newfd</code> already corresponds to the FD of an opened file, the FD on the file that's already opened is automatically closed.</p><p>For example, the current process opens <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> whose FD is <code>1</code>. To replace this opened file with <code>/var/run/test/a</code>, this process performs the following operations:</p><ol><li>Uses the <code>fcntl</code> system call to get the <code>OFlags</code> (the parameter used by the <code>open</code> system call, such as <code>O_WRONLY</code>) of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>Iseek</code> system call to get the current location of <code>seek</code>.</li><li>Uses the <code>open</code> system call to open <code>/var/run/test/a</code> using the same <code>OFlags</code>. Assume that the FD is <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>Iseek</code> to change the <code>seek</code> location of the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Uses <code>dup2(2, 1)</code> to replace the FD <code>1</code> of <code>/var/run/__chaosfs__test__/a</code> with the newly opened FD <code>2</code>.</li><li>Closes FD <code>2</code>.</li></ol><p>After the process is finished, FD <code>1</code> of the current process points to <code>/var/run/test/a</code>. So that we can inject faults, any subsequent operations on the target file go through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_in_Userspace" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Filesystem in Userspace</a> (FUSE). FUSE is a software interface for Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that lets non-privileged users create their own file systems without editing kernel code.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="write-a-program-to-make-the-target-process-replace-its-own-file-descriptor">Write a program to make the target process replace its own file descriptor<a href="#write-a-program-to-make-the-target-process-replace-its-own-file-descriptor" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Write a program to make the target process replace its own file descriptor" title="Direct link to Write a program to make the target process replace its own file descriptor">​</a></h4><p>The combined functionality of ptrace and dup2 makes it possible for the tracer to make the tracee replace the opened FD by itself. Now, we need to write a binary program and make the target process run it:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>In the implementation above, we assume that:</p><ul><li>The threads of the target process are POSIX threads and share the opened files.</li><li>When the target process creates threads using the <code>clone</code> function, the <code>CLONE_FILES</code> parameter is passed.</li></ul><p>Therefore, Chaos Mesh only replaces the FD of the first thread in the thread group.</p></blockquote><ol><li>Write a piece of assembly code according to the two sections above and the usage of syscall directives. <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/toda/blob/1d73871d8ab72b8d1eace55f5222b01957193531/src/replacer/fd_replacer.rs#L133" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is an example of the assembly code.</li><li>Use an assembler to translate the code into a binary program.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="How-a-Top-Game-Company-Uses-Chaos-Engineering-to-Improve-Testing" src="/assets/images/fuxi-case-banner-533004456baeaec37f72c0d6aaed0f2b.jpg" width="3126" height="1043" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>NetEase Fuxi AI Lab is China’s first professional game AI research institution. Researchers use our Kubernetes-based Danlu platform for algorithm development, training and tuning, and online publishing. Thanks to the integration with Kubernetes, our platform is much more efficient. However, due to Kubernetes- and microservices-related issues, we are constantly testing and improving our platform to make it more stable.</p><p>In this article, I’ll discuss one of our most valuable testing tools, <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a>. Chaos Mesh is an open-source Chaos Engineering tool that provides a wide range of fault injections and excellent fault monitoring through its Dashboard.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="why-chaos-mesh">Why Chaos Mesh<a href="#why-chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Chaos Mesh" title="Direct link to Why Chaos Mesh">​</a></h2><p>We started our search for a Chaos Engineering tool in 2018. We were looking for a tool with:</p><ul><li><p>Cloud-native support. Kubernetes is practically the de facto standard for service orchestration and scheduling, and the application runtime has been fully standardized. For applications that run entirely on K8s, cloud-native support is a must for any tools that go with them.</p></li><li><p>Sufficient fault injection types. For stateful services, network failure simulation is particularly important. The platform must be able to simulate failures at different levels, such as Pods, network, and I/O.</p></li><li><p>Good observability. Knowing when a fault is injected and when it can be recovered is vital for us to tell whether there is an abnormality in the application.</p></li><li><p>Active community support. We want to use an open-source project that is thoroughly tested and consistently maintained. That’s why we value sustained and timely community support.</p></li><li><p>No intrusion on existing applications, with no domain knowledge required.</p></li><li><p>Actual use cases for us to evaluate and build upon.</p></li></ul><p>In 2019, when Chaos Mesh, a Chaos Engineering platform for Kubernetes was open-sourced, we found the tool we were looking for. It was still in its early stage; however, we were immediately struck with the richness of fault types it supported. This was a big advantage over other chaos engineering tools, because, to a certain degree, it determines the number of issues that we can locate in the system. We instantly realized that Chaos Mesh met our expectations in almost every way.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh architecture" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-architecture-c61ce59a7a241d180a6156b8a6202f34.png" width="941" height="631" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="our-journey-with-chaos-mesh">Our journey with Chaos Mesh<a href="#our-journey-with-chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Our journey with Chaos Mesh" title="Direct link to Our journey with Chaos Mesh">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh has helped us find several important bugs. For example, it detected a brain-split issue in <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rabbitMQ</a>, the open-source message-queueing software for Danlu. According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, “a split-brain condition indicates data or availability inconsistencies originating from the maintenance of two separate data sets with overlap in scope.” When a rabbitMQ cluster has a brain split error, there will be data write conflicts or errors, which cause more serious problems such as data inconsistencies in the messaging service. As shown in our architecture below, when brain split happens, consumers do not function normally and keep reporting server exceptions.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Architecture of a RabbitMQ cluster" src="/assets/images/architecture-of-a-rabbitmq-cluster-dde2aba82a73d21c4cb35ab9035b844e.png" width="941" height="820" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>With Chaos Mesh, we could stably reproduce this issue by injecting <code>pod-kill</code> faults into our container instances cloud.</p><p>Chaos Mesh also found several other issues including a startup failure, a join failure for crashed broker clusters, a heartbeat timeout, and a connection channel shutdown. Over time, our development team fixed these issues and greatly improved the stability of the Danlu platform.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="a-fast-growing-project">A fast-growing project<a href="#a-fast-growing-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A fast-growing project" title="Direct link to A fast-growing project">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh is constantly updated and improved. When we first adopted it, it hadn’t even reached a stable version. It didn’t have a debugging or log collection tool, and the Dashboard component only applied to TiDB. The only way we could use Chaos Mesh to test other applications was to execute the YAML configuration file via <code>kubectl apply</code>.</p><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/blog/chaos-mesh-1.0-chaos-engineering-on-kubernetes-made-easier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh 1.0</a> fixed or improved most of these limitations. It offers more fine-grained and powerful chaos support, a generally-available Chaos Dashboard, enhanced observability, and more accurate chaos scope control. These are all driven by an open, collaborative, and vibrant community.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Dashboard is now generally available" src="/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif" width="1920" height="968" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="looking-forward">Looking forward<a href="#looking-forward" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Looking forward" title="Direct link to Looking forward">​</a></h2><p>It’s amazing to see how much Chaos Mesh has grown and how much traction it’s gaining. We’re also happy with what we have achieved with it.</p><p>However, Chaos Engineering is a big area to work on. In the future, we’d like to see the following features:</p><ul><li><p>Atomic fault injection</p></li><li><p>Unattended fault inject that combines customized fault types with standardized methods to validate experimental objects</p></li><li><p>Standard test cases for general components such as MySQL, Redis, and Kafka</p></li></ul><p>We’ve discussed these features with those who maintain Chaos Mesh, and they said these features are on the Chaos Mesh 2.0 roadmap.</p><p>If you are interested, join the Chaos Mesh community via <a href="https://slack.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> (#project-chaos-mesh) or <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Netflix gave birth to Chaos engineering because of their necessity.</p><p>In 2008, Netflix <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/completing-the-netflix-cloud-migration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">experienced a major database corruption</a>. They couldn't deliver DVDs for three days. This encouraged Netflix engineers to think about their monolithic architecture’s migration to a distributed cloud-based architecture.</p><p>The new distributed architecture of Netflix composed of hundreds of microservices. Migration to distributed architecture solved their single point failure problem, but it gave rise to many other complexities requiring a more reliable and fault-tolerant system. At this point, Netflix engineers came up with an innovative idea to test the system’s fault tolerance without impacting customer service.</p><p>They created <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/chaosmonkey" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Monkey</a>: a tool that causes random failures at different places with different intervals of time. With the development of Chaos Monkey, a new discipline arises: Chaos Engineering.</p><p>“Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the system’s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.” - <a href="https://principlesofchaos.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Principle of Chaos</a></p><p>Chaos Engineering is an approach for learning how your system behaves by applying a discipline of empirical exploration. Just as scientists conduct experiments to study physical and social phenomena, Chaos Engineering uses experiments to learn about a particular system - the systems' reliability, stability, and capability to survive in unexpected or unstable conditions.</p><p>When we have a large-scale distributed system, failures could be caused by a number of factors like application failure, infrastructure failure, dependency failure, network failure, and many more. These failures could not be all covered by traditional methods such as integration testing or unit testing, which makes Chaos Engineering a necessity:</p><ul><li>To improve resiliency of the system</li><li>To expose hidden threats and vulnerability of the system</li><li>To figure out system weaknesses before they cause any failure in production</li></ul><p>Lots of people think that they are not as big compared to Netflix and other tech giants; nor do they have any databases or systems of that scale.</p><p>They are probably right, but over the period, Chaos engineering has evolved so much that it’s no longer limited to digital companies like Netflix. To ensure consistent performance and constant availability of their systems, more and more companies from different industries are implementing chaos experiments.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="chaos-mesh">Chaos-Mesh<a href="#chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Chaos-Mesh" title="Direct link to Chaos-Mesh">​</a></h2><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_UlAA"><div class="admonitionHeading_Kv5A"><span class="admonitionIcon__V4t"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_nNvp"><p>2022-10-24: Because of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html</a>, and refer to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/website/pull/356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#356</a>, the interactive tutorial is temporarily unavailable.</p></div></div><p>To test the resiliency and reliability of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, engineers at <a href="https://pingcap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PingCAP</a> came up with a fantastic tool for Chaos testing called <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a>, a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos on Kubernetes environments.

After 10 months of effort within the open-source community, Chaos Mesh is now ready in terms of functionality, scalability, and ease of use. Here are some highlights.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="powerful-chaos-support">Powerful chaos support<a href="#powerful-chaos-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Powerful chaos support" title="Direct link to Powerful chaos support">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://chaos-mesh.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> originated in the testing framework of <a href="https://pingcap.com/products/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, a distributed database, so it takes into account the possible faults of a distributed system. Chaos Mesh provides comprehensive and fine-grained fault types, covering the Pod, the network, system I/O, and the kernel. Chaos experiments are defined in YAML, which is fast and easy to use.</p><p>Chaos Mesh 1.0 supports the following fault types:</p><ul><li>clock-skew: Simulates clock skew</li><li>container-kill: Simulates the container being killed</li><li>cpu-burn: Simulates CPU pressure</li><li>io-attribution-override: Simulates file exceptions</li><li>io-fault: Simulates file system I/O errors</li><li>io-latency: Simulates file system I/O latency</li><li>kernel-injection: Simulates kernel failures</li><li>memory-burn: Simulates memory pressure</li><li>network-corrupt: Simulates network packet corruption</li><li>network-duplication: Simulates network packet duplication</li><li>network-latency: Simulate network latency</li><li>network-loss: Simulates network loss</li><li>network-partition: Simulates network partition</li><li>pod-failure: Simulates continuous unavailability of Kubernetes Pods</li><li>pod-kill: Simulates the Kubernetes Pod being killed</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="visual-chaos-orchestration">Visual chaos orchestration<a href="#visual-chaos-orchestration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Visual chaos orchestration" title="Direct link to Visual chaos orchestration">​</a></h2><p>The Chaos Dashboard component is a one-stop web interface for Chaos Mesh users to orchestrate chaos experiments. Previously, Chaos Dashboard was only available for testing TiDB. With Chaos Mesh 1.0, it is available to everyone. Chaos Dashboard greatly simplifies the complexity of chaos experiments. With only a few mouse clicks, you can define the scope of the chaos experiment, specify the type of chaos injection, define scheduling rules, and observe the results of the chaos experiment—all in the same web interface.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Dashboard" src="/assets/images/chaos-dashboard-0a1e48c54968d276f174801a1364ce21.gif" width="1920" height="968" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="grafana-plug-in-for-enhanced-observability">Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability<a href="#grafana-plug-in-for-enhanced-observability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability" title="Direct link to Grafana plug-in for enhanced observability">​</a></h2><p>To further improve the observability of chaos experiments, Chaos Mesh 1.0 includes a Grafana plug-in to allow you to directly display real-time chaos experiment information on your application monitoring panel. Currently, the chaos experiment information is displayed as annotations. This way, you can simultaneously observe the running status of the application and the current chaos experiment information.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos status and application status on Grafana" src="/assets/images/chaos-status-460b054f3e2ee0898d2236a5137bc30e.png" width="1600" height="790" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="safe-and-controllable-chaos">Safe and controllable chaos<a href="#safe-and-controllable-chaos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Safe and controllable chaos" title="Direct link to Safe and controllable chaos">​</a></h2><p>When we conduct chaos experiments, it is vital that we keep strict control over the chaos scope or “blast radius.” Chaos Mesh 1.0 not only provides a wealth of selectors to accurately control the scope of the experiment, but it also enables you to set protected Namespaces to protect important applications. You can also use Namespace permissions to limit the scope of Chaos Mesh to a specific Namespace. Together, these features make chaos experiments with Chaos Mesh safe and controllable.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="try-it-out-now">Try it out now<a href="#try-it-out-now" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Try it out now" title="Direct link to Try it out now">​</a></h2><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_UlAA"><div class="admonitionHeading_Kv5A"><span class="admonitionIcon__V4t"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_nNvp"><p>2022-10-24: Because of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/leveraging-katacoda-technology.html</a>, and refer to <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/website/pull/356" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#356</a>, the interactive tutorial is temporarily unavailable.</p></div></div><p>You can quickly deploy Chaos Mesh in your Kubernetes environment through the <code>install.sh</code> script or the Helm tool.

While it’s well received in the community with its rich fault injection types and easy-to-use dashboard, it was difficult to use Chaos Mesh with end-to-end testing or the continuous integration (CI) process. As a result, problems introduced during system development could not be discovered before the release.</p><p>In this article, I will share how we use chaos-mesh-action, a GitHub action to integrate Chaos Mesh into the CI process.</p><p>chaos-mesh-action is available on <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub market</a>, and the source code is on <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="design-of-chaos-mesh-action">Design of chaos-mesh-action<a href="#design-of-chaos-mesh-action" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design of chaos-mesh-action" title="Direct link to Design of chaos-mesh-action">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Action</a> is a CI/CD feature natively supported by GitHub, through which we can easily build automated and customized software development workflows in the GitHub repository.</p><p>Combined with GitHub actions, Chaos Mesh can be more easily integrated into the daily development and testing of the system, thus guaranteeing that each code submission on GitHub is bug-free and won’t damage existing code.

Although it provides rich capabilities to simulate abnormal system conditions, it still only solves a fraction of the Chaos Engineering puzzle. Besides fault injection, a full chaos engineering application consists of hypothesizing around defined steady states, running experiments in production, validating the system via test cases, and automating the testing.</p><p>This article describes how we use <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a>, an automated testing framework to build a full Chaos Engineering testing loop for TiDB, our distributed database.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="why-do-we-need-tipocket">Why do we need TiPocket?<a href="#why-do-we-need-tipocket" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why do we need TiPocket?" title="Direct link to Why do we need TiPocket?">​</a></h2><p>Before we can put a distributed system like <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a> into production, we have to ensure that it is robust enough for day-to-day use. For this reason, several years ago we introduced Chaos Engineering into our testing framework. In our testing framework, we:</p><ol><li>Observe the normal metrics and develop our testing hypothesis.</li><li>Inject a list of failures into TiDB.</li><li>Run various test cases to verify TiDB in fault scenarios.</li><li>Monitor and collect test results for analysis and diagnosis.</li></ol><p>This sounds like a solid process, and we’ve used it for years. However, as TiDB evolves, the testing scale multiplies. We have multiple fault scenarios, against which dozens of test cases run in the Kubernetes testing cluster. Even with Chaos Mesh helping to inject failures, the remaining work can still be demanding—not to mention the challenge of automating the pipeline to make the testing scalable and efficient.</p><p>This is why we built TiPocket, a fully-automated testing framework based on Kubernetes and Chaos Mesh. Currently, we mainly use it to test TiDB clusters. However, because of TiPocket’s Kubernetes-friendly design and extensible interface, you can use Kubernetes’ create and delete logic to easily support other applications.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="how-does-it-work">How does it work<a href="#how-does-it-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does it work" title="Direct link to How does it work">​</a></h2><p>Based on the above requirements, we need an automatic workflow that:</p><ul><li><a href="#injecting-chaos---chaos-mesh">Injects chaos</a></li><li><a href="#verifying-chaos-impacts-test-cases">Verifies the impact of that chaos</a></li><li><a href="#automating-the-chaos-pipeline---argo">Automates the chaos pipeline</a></li><li><a href="#visualizing-the-results-loki">Visualizes the results</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="injecting-chaos---chaos-mesh">Injecting chaos - Chaos Mesh<a href="#injecting-chaos---chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Injecting chaos - Chaos Mesh" title="Direct link to Injecting chaos - Chaos Mesh">​</a></h3><p>Fault injection is the core chaos testing. In a distributed database, faults can happen anytime, anywhere—from node crashes, network partitions, and file system failures, to kernel panics. This is where Chaos Mesh comes in.</p><p>Currently, TiPocket supports the following types of fault injection:</p><ul><li><strong>Network</strong>: Simulates network partitions, random packet loss, disorder, duplication, or delay of links.</li><li><strong>Time skew</strong>: Simulates clock skew of the container to be tested.</li><li><strong>Kill</strong>: Kills the specified pod, either randomly in a cluster or within a component (TiDB, TiKV, or Placement Driver (PD)).</li><li><strong>I/O</strong>: Injects I/O delays in TiDB’s storage engine, TiKV, to identify I/O related issues.</li></ul><p>With fault injection handled, we need to think about verification. How do we make sure TiDB can survive these faults?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="verifying-chaos-impacts-test-cases">Verifying chaos impacts: test cases<a href="#verifying-chaos-impacts-test-cases" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Verifying chaos impacts: test cases" title="Direct link to Verifying chaos impacts: test cases">​</a></h2><p>To validate how TiDB withstands chaos, we implemented dozens of test cases in TiPocket, combined with a variety of inspection tools. To give you an overview of how TiPocket verifies TiDB in the event of failures, consider the following test cases. These cases focus on SQL execution, transaction consistency, and transaction isolation.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="fuzz-testing-sqlsmith">Fuzz testing: SQLsmith<a href="#fuzz-testing-sqlsmith" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fuzz testing: SQLsmith" title="Direct link to Fuzz testing: SQLsmith">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/go-sqlsmith" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SQLsmith</a> is a tool that generates random SQL queries. TiPocket creates a TiDB cluster and a MySQL instance.. The random SQL generated by SQLsmith is executed on TiDB and MySQL, and various faults are injected into the TiDB cluster to test. In the end, execution results are compared. If we detect inconsistencies, there are potential issues with our system.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="transaction-consistency-testing-bank-and-porcupine">Transaction consistency testing: Bank and Porcupine<a href="#transaction-consistency-testing-bank-and-porcupine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transaction consistency testing: Bank and Porcupine" title="Direct link to Transaction consistency testing: Bank and Porcupine">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/cmd/bank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bank</a> is a classical test case that simulates the transfer process in a banking system. Under snapshot isolation, all transfers must ensure that the total amount of all accounts must be consistent at every moment, even in the face of system failures. If there are inconsistencies in the total amount, there are potential issues with our system.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> is a linearizability checker in Go built to test the correctness of distributed systems. It takes a sequential specification as executable Go code, along with a concurrent history, and it determines whether the history is linearizable with respect to the sequential specification. In TiPocket, we use the <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/check/porcupine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Porcupine</a> checker in multiple test cases to check whether TiDB meets the linearizability constraint.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="transaction-isolation-testing-elle">Transaction Isolation testing: Elle<a href="#transaction-isolation-testing-elle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Transaction Isolation testing: Elle" title="Direct link to Transaction Isolation testing: Elle">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://github.com/jepsen-io/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a> is an inspection tool that verifies a database’s transaction isolation level. TiPocket integrates <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/pkg/elle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">go-elle</a>, the Go implementation of the Elle inspection tool, to verify TiDB’s isolation level.</p><p>These are just a few of the test cases TiPocket uses to verify TiDB’s accuracy and stability.

Two options come to mind: we could implement the scheduling functionality in TiPocket, or hand over the job to existing open-source tools. To make TiPocket more dedicated to the testing part of our workflow, we chose the open-source tools approach. This, plus our all-in-K8s design, lead us directly to <a href="https://github.com/argoproj/argo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Argo</a>.</p><p>Argo is a workflow engine designed for Kubernetes. It has been an open source product for a long time, and has received widespread attention and application.</p><p>Argo has abstracted several custom resource definitions (CRDs) for workflows. The most important ones include Workflow Template, Workflow, and Cron Workflow. Here is how Argo fits in TiPocket:</p><ul><li><strong>Workflow Template</strong> is a template defined in advance for each test task. Parameters can be passed in when the test is running.</li><li><strong>Workflow</strong> schedules multiple workflow templates in different orders, which form the tasks to be executed. Argo also lets you add conditions, loops, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) in the pipeline.</li><li><strong>Cron Workflow</strong> lets you schedule a workflow like a cron job. It is perfectly suitable for scenarios where you want to run test tasks for a long time.</li></ul><p>The sample workflow for our predefined bank test is shown below:</p><div class="language-yml

specific failure to inject. You can reuse the template to define multiple workflows that suit different test cases. This allows you to add more customized failure injections in the flow.</p><p>Besides <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket/tree/master/argo/workflow" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket’s</a> sample workflows and templates, the design also allows you to add your own failure injection flows. Handling complicated logics using codable workflows makes Argo developer-friendly and an ideal choice for our scenarios.</p><p>Now, our chaos experiment is running automatically. But if our results do not meet our expectations? How do we locate the problem? TiDB saves a variety of monitoring information, which makes log collecting essential for enabling observability in TiPocket.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="visualizing-the-results-loki">Visualizing the results: Loki<a href="#visualizing-the-results-loki" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Visualizing the results: Loki" title="Direct link to Visualizing the results: Loki">​</a></h2><p>In cloud-native systems, observability is very important. Generally speaking, you can achieve observability through <strong>metrics</strong>, <strong>logging</strong>, and <strong>tracing</strong>. TiPocket’s main test cases evaluate TiDB clusters, so metrics and logs are our default sources for locating issues.</p><p>On Kubernetes, Prometheus is the de-facto standard for metrics. However, there is no common way for log collection. Solutions such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Elasticsearch</a>, <a href="https://fluentbit.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fluent Bit</a>, and <a href="https://www.elastic.co/kibana" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kibana</a> perform well, but they may cause system resource contention and high maintenance costs. We decided to use <a href="https://github.com/grafana/loki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loki</a>, the Prometheus-like log aggregation system from <a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grafana</a>.</p><p>Prometheus processes TiDB’s monitoring information. Prometheus and Loki have a similar labeling system, so we can easily combine Prometheus' monitoring indicators with the corresponding pod logs and use a similar query language. Grafana also supports the Loki dashboard, which means we can use Grafana to display monitoring indicators and logs at the same time. Grafana is the built-in monitoring component in TiDB, which Loki can reuse.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="putting-them-all-together---tipocket">Putting them all together - TiPocket<a href="#putting-them-all-together---tipocket" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Putting them all together - TiPocket" title="Direct link to Putting them all together - TiPocket">​</a></h2><p>Now, everything is ready. Here is a simplified diagram of TiPocket:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="TiPocket Architecture" src="/assets/images/tipocket-architecture-fcff5a8fa8690055253b89c9808f1197.png" width="1600" height="669" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>As you can see, the Argo workflow manages all chaos experiments and test cases. Generally, a complete test cycle involves the following steps:</p><ol><li>Argo creates a Cron Workflow, which defines the cluster to be tested, the faults to inject, the test case, and the duration of the task. If necessary, the Cron Workflow also lets you view case logs in real-time.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Argo Workflow" src="/assets/images/argo-workflow-2d7506b3c1525da6f97b4ef811594461.png" width="1600" height="743" class="img_eJzl"></p><ol><li>At a specified time, a separate TiPocket thread is started in the workflow, and the Cron Workflow is triggered. TiPocket sends TiDB-Operator the definition of the cluster to test. In turn, TiDB-Operator creates a target TiDB cluster. Meanwhile, Loki collects the related logs.</li><li>Chaos Mesh injects faults in the cluster.</li><li>Using the test cases mentioned above, the user validates the health of the system. Any test case failure leads to workflow failure in Argo, which triggers Alertmanager to send the result to the specified Slack channel. If the test cases complete normally, the cluster is cleared, and Argo stands by until the next test.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Alert in Slack" src="/assets/images/alert_message-79bc9f3976c4781bc320238a8ec6d818.png" width="1426" height="384" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>This is the complete TiPocket workflow. .</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="join-us">Join us<a href="#join-us" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Join us" title="Direct link to Join us">​</a></h2><p><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tipocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiPocket</a> are both in active iterations.

As maintainers of Chaos Mesh, we’d like to thank all the contributors and adopters. This would not be possible without your trust, support, and contributions.</p><p>Chaos Mesh is a powerful Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos experiments on Kubernetes environments. By covering comprehensive fault injection methods in Pod, network, file system, and even the kernel, we aim at providing a neutral, universal Chaos Engineering platform that enables cloud-native applications to be as resilient as they should be.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Architecture" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-79ecf122938b5863a1baf9d64b1ccd8d.svg" width="4768" height="3197" class="img_eJzl"></p><p>Within only 7 months since it was open-sourced on December 31st, 2019, Chaos Mesh has already received 2000 GitHub stars, with 44 contributors from multiple organizations. As a young project, the adoption in production has been the key recognition and motivation that pushes us forward constantly. Here is a list of our adopters so far:</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.pingcap.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PingCAP</a></li><li><a href="https://en.xiaopeng.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xpeng Motor</a></li><li><a href="https://fuxi.163.com/fuxi-introduction" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NetEase Fuxi Lab</a></li><li><a href="http://juicefs.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JuiceFS</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dailymotion</a></li><li><a href="https://about.meituan.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meituan-Dianping</a></li><li><a href="https://celo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Celo</a></li></ul><p>Being a CNCF Sandbox project marks a major step forward for the project. It means that Chaos Mesh has become part of the great vendor-neutral cloud-native community. With the guidance and help from CNCF, Chaos Mesh will strive to develop a community with transparent, meritocracy-based governance for open communication and open collaboration, while driving the project forward, towards our ultimate goal of establishing the Chaos Engineering standards on Cloud. Currently, Chaos Mesh is in active development for 1.0 GA. Going forward, we will be focusing on the following aspects:</p><ul><li>Lowering the bar of chaos engineering by improving Chaos Dashboard.</li><li>Extending chaos injection to application layers</li><li>Completing the full chaos engineering loop with status checking, reporting, and scenario defining, etc.</li></ul><p>If you are interested in the project, check out our <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>, join our <a href="https://slack.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack</a> discussions, or attend our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H8IfmhIJiJ1ltg-XLjqR_P_RaMHUGrl1CzvHnKM_9Sc/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monthly meeting</a> to know more.

Usually, when we modify clocks in a container, we want a <a href="https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/chaos-engineering/9781491988459/ch07.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">minimized blast radius</a>, and we don't want the change to affect the other containers on the node. In reality, however, implementing this can be harder than you think. How does Chaos Mesh solve this problem?</p><p>In this post, I'll describe how we hacked through different approaches of clock skew and how TimeChaos in Chaos Mesh enables time to swing freely in containers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="simulating-clock-skew-without-affecting-other-containers-on-the-node">Simulating clock skew without affecting other containers on the node<a href="#simulating-clock-skew-without-affecting-other-containers-on-the-node" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Simulating clock skew without affecting other containers on the node" title="Direct link to Simulating clock skew without affecting other containers on the node">​</a></h2><p>Clock skew refers to the time difference between clocks on nodes within a network. It might cause reliability problems in a distributed system, and it's a concern for designers and developers of complex distributed systems. For example, in a distributed SQL database, it's vital to maintain a synchronized local clock across nodes to achieve a consistent global snapshot and ensure the ACID properties for transactions.</p><p>Currently, there are well-recognized <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/Time-in-Distributed-Systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">solutions to synchronize clocks</a>, but without proper testing, you can never be sure that your implementation is solid.</p><p>Then how can we test global snapshot consistency in a distributed system? The answer is obvious: we can simulate clock skew to test whether distributed systems can keep a consistent global snapshot under abnormal clock conditions. Some testing tools support simulating clock skew in containers, but they have an impact on physical nodes.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/wiki/Time-Chaos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TimeChaos</a> is a tool that <strong>simulates clock skew in containers to test how it impacts your application without affecting the whole node</strong>. This way, we can precisely identify the potential consequences of clock skew and take measures accordingly.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="various-approaches-for-simulating-clock-skew-weve-explored">Various approaches for simulating clock skew we've explored<a href="#various-approaches-for-simulating-clock-skew-weve-explored" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Various approaches for simulating clock skew we've explored" title="Direct link to Various approaches for simulating clock skew we've explored">​</a></h2><p>Reviewing the existing choices, we know clearly that they cannot be applied to Chaos Mesh, which runs on Kubernetes. Two common ways of simulating clock skew--changing the node clock directly and using the Jepsen framework--change the time for all processes on the node. These are not acceptable solutions for us. In a Kubernetes container, if we inject a clock skew error that affects the entire node, other containers on the same node will be disturbed. Such a clumsy approach is not tolerable.</p><p>Then how are we supposed to tackle this problem? Well, the first thing that comes into our mind is finding solutions in the kernel using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Berkeley Packet Filter</a> (BPF).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="ld_preload"><code>LD_PRELOAD</code><a href="#ld_preload" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ld_preload" title="Direct link to ld_preload">​</a></h3><p><code>LD_PRELOAD</code> is a Linux environment variable that lets you define which dynamic link library is loaded before the program execution.</p><p>This variable has two advantages:</p><ul><li>We can call our own functions without being aware of the source code.</li><li>We can inject code into other programs to achieve specific purposes.</li></ul><p>For some languages that use applications to call the time function in glibc, such as Rust and C, using <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> is enough to simulate clock skew. But things are trickier for Golang. Because languages such as Golang directly parse virtual Dynamic Shared Object (<a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/vdso.7.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vDSO</a>), a mechanism to speed up system calls. To obtain the time function address, we can't simply use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to intercept the glic interface. Therefore, <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> is not our solution.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="use-bpf-to-modify-the-return-value-of-clock_gettime-system-call">Use BPF to modify the return value of <code>clock_gettime</code> system call<a href="#use-bpf-to-modify-the-return-value-of-clock_gettime-system-call" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to use-bpf-to-modify-the-return-value-of-clock_gettime-system-call" title="Direct link to use-bpf-to-modify-the-return-value-of-clock_gettime-system-call">​</a></h3><p>We also tried to filter the task <a href="http://www.linfo.org/pid.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">process identification number</a> (PID) with BPF. This way, we could simulate clock skew on a specified process and modify the return value of the <code>clock_gettime</code> system call.</p><p>This seemed like a good idea, but we also encountered a problem: in most cases, vDSO speeds up <code>clock_gettime</code>, but <code>clock_gettime</code> doesn't make a system call. This selection didn't work, either. Oops.</p><p>Thankfully, we determined that if the system kernel version is 4.18 or later, and if we use the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/timers/hpet.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HPET</a> clock, <code>clock_gettime()</code> gets time by making normal system calls instead of vDSO. We implemented <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/bpfki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a version of clock skew</a> using this approach, and it works fine for Rust and C. As for Golang, the program can get the time right, but if we perform <code>sleep</code> during the clock skew injection, the sleep operation is very likely to be blocked. Even after the injection is canceled, the system cannot recover. Thus, we have to give up this approach, too.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="timechaos-our-final-hack">TimeChaos, our final hack<a href="#timechaos-our-final-hack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TimeChaos, our final hack" title="Direct link to TimeChaos, our final hack">​</a></h2><p>From the previous section, we know that programs usually get the system time by calling <code>clock_gettime</code>. In our case, <code>clock_gettime</code> uses vDSO to speed up the calling process, so we cannot use <code>LD_PRELOAD</code> to hack the <code>clock_gettime</code> system calls.</p><p>We figured out the cause; then what's the solution? Start from vDSO. If we can redirect the address that stores the <code>clock_gettime</code> return value in vDSO to an address we define, we can solve the problem.</p><p>Easier said than done. To achieve this goal, we must tackle the following problems:</p><ul><li>Know the user-mode address used by vDSO</li><li>Know vDSO's kernel-mode address, if we want to modify the <code>clock_gettime</code> function in vDSO by any address in the kernel mode</li><li>Know how to modify vDSO data</li></ul><p>First, we need to peek inside vDSO. We can see the vDSO memory address in <code>/proc/pid/maps</code>.</p><div class="codeBlockContainer_lDW9 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#F8F8F2;--prism-background-color:#282A36"><div class="codeBlockContent_gKCn"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_Vp2e thin-scrollbar"><code class="codeBlockLines_M2tE"><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">$ cat /proc/pid/maps</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">...</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#F8F8F2"><span class="token plain">7ffe53143000-7ffe53145000 r-xp 00000000 00:00 0                     [vdso]</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup_IyHw"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_d7vL" aria-hidden="true"><svg class="copyButtonIcon_yBVr" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LYGl" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div><p>The last line is vDSO information.

For many people, however, the transition from learning Chaos Engineering to practicing it on their own systems is daunting. It sounds like one of those big ideas that require a fully-equipped team to plan ahead. Well, it doesn't have to be. To get started with chaos experimenting, you may be just one suitable platform away.</p><p><a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Mesh</a> is an <strong>easy-to-use</strong>, open-source, cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos in Kubernetes environments. This 10-minute tutorial will help you quickly get started with Chaos Engineering and run your first chaos experiment with Chaos Mesh.</p><p>For more information about Chaos Mesh, refer to our <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/chaos-mesh-your-chaos-engineering-solution-for-system-resiliency-on-kubernetes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous article</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chaos-mesh project</a> on GitHub.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="a-preview-of-our-little-experiment">A preview of our little experiment<a href="#a-preview-of-our-little-experiment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A preview of our little experiment" title="Direct link to A preview of our little experiment">​</a></h2><p>Chaos experiments are similar to experiments we do in a science class. It's perfectly fine to stimulate turbulent situations in a controlled environment. In our case here, we will be simulating network chaos on a small web application called <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/web-show" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web-show</a>. To visualize the chaos effect, web-show records the latency from its pod to the kube-controller pod (under the namespace of <code>kube-system</code>) every 10 seconds.</p><p>The following clip shows the process of installing Chaos Mesh, deploying web-show, and creating the chaos experiment within a few commands:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="The whole process of the chaos experiment" src="/assets/images/whole-process-of-chaos-experiment-f244c2133045486ab9c715b740f0c728.gif" width="800" height="450" class="img_eJzl"></p><div class="caption-center"> The whole process of the chaos experiment </div><p>Now it's your turn!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Engineering" src="/assets/images/chaos-engineering-0a7a0b74bf0c31599b29b2ddc1069830.png" width="900" height="402" class="img_eJzl"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="why-chaos-mesh">Why Chaos Mesh?<a href="#why-chaos-mesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why Chaos Mesh?" title="Direct link to Why Chaos Mesh?">​</a></h2><p>In the world of distributed computing, faults can happen to your clusters unpredictably any time, anywhere. Traditionally we have unit tests and integration tests that guarantee a system is production ready, but these cover just the tip of the iceberg as clusters scale, complexities amount, and data volumes increase by PB levels. To better identify system vulnerabilities and improve resilience, Netflix invented <a href="https://netflix.github.io/chaosmonkey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chaos Monkey</a> and injects various types of faults into the infrastructure and business systems. This is how Chaos Engineering was originated.</p><p>At <a href="https://chaos-mesh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PingCAP</a>, we are facing the same problem while building <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiDB</a>, an open source distributed NewSQL database. To be fault tolerant, or resilient holds especially true to us, because the most important asset for any database users, the data itself, is at stake. To ensure resilience, we started <a href="https://pingcap.com/blog/chaos-practice-in-tidb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">practicing Chaos Engineering</a> internally in our testing framework from a very early stage. However, as TiDB grew, so did the testing requirements. We realized that we needed a universal chaos testing platform, not just for TiDB, but also for other distributed systems.</p><p>Therefore, we present to you Chaos Mesh, a cloud-native Chaos Engineering platform that orchestrates chaos experiments on Kubernetes environments. It's an open source project available at <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh</a>.</p><p>In the following sections, I will share with you what Chaos Mesh is, how we design and implement it, and finally I will show you how you can use it in your environment.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="what-can-chaos-mesh-do">What can Chaos Mesh do?<a href="#what-can-chaos-mesh-do" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What can Chaos Mesh do?" title="Direct link to What can Chaos Mesh do?">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh is a versatile Chaos Engineering platform that features all-around fault injection methods for complex systems on Kubernetes, covering faults in Pod, network, file system, and even the kernel.</p><p>Here is an example of how we use Chaos Mesh to locate a TiDB system bug. In this example, we simulate Pod downtime with our distributed storage engine (<a href="https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/tidb-architecture#tikv-server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TiKV</a>) and observe changes in queries per second (QPS). Regularly, if one TiKV node is down, the QPS may experience a transient jitter before it returns to the level before the failure. This is how we guarantee high availability.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh discovers downtime recovery exceptions in TiKV" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-discovers-downtime-recovery-exceptions-in-tikv-1d52a2abba675a8b9ee6d00660c5e7b0.png" width="600" height="290" class="img_eJzl"></p><div class="caption-center"> Chaos Mesh discovers downtime recovery exceptions in TiKV</div><p>As you can see from the dashboard:</p><ul><li>During the first two downtimes, the QPS returns to normal after about 1 minute.</li><li>After the third downtime, however, the QPS takes much longer to recover—about 9 minutes. Such a long downtime is unexpected, and it would definitely impact online services.</li></ul><p>After some diagnosis, we found the TiDB cluster version under test (V3.0.1) had some tricky issues when handling TiKV downtimes. We resolved these issues in later versions.</p><p>But Chaos Mesh can do a lot more than just simulate downtime. It also includes these fault injection methods:</p><ul><li><strong>pod-kill:</strong> Simulates Kubernetes Pods being killed</li><li><strong>pod-failure:</strong> Simulates Kubernetes Pods being continuously unavailable</li><li><strong>network-delay:</strong> Simulates network delay</li><li><strong>network-loss:</strong> Simulates network packet loss</li><li><strong>network-duplication:</strong> Simulates network packet duplication</li><li><strong>network-corrupt:</strong> Simulates network packet corruption</li><li><strong>network-partition:</strong> Simulates network partition</li><li><strong>I/O delay:</strong> Simulates file system I/O delay</li><li><strong>I/O errno:</strong> Simulates file system I/O errors</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="design-principles">Design principles<a href="#design-principles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Design principles" title="Direct link to Design principles">​</a></h2><p>We designed Chaos Mesh to be easy to use, scalable, and designed for Kubernetes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="easy-to-use">Easy to use<a href="#easy-to-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Easy to use" title="Direct link to Easy to use">​</a></h3><p>To be easy to use, Chaos Mesh must:</p><ul><li>Require no special dependencies, so that it can be deployed directly on Kubernetes clusters, including <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minikube</a>.</li><li>Require no modification to the deployment logic of the system under test (SUT), so that chaos experiments can be performed in a production environment.</li><li>Easily orchestrate fault injection behaviors in chaos experiments, and easily view experiment status and results. You should also be able to quickly rollback injected failures.</li><li>Hide underlying implementation details so that users can focus on orchestrating the chaos experiments.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="scalable">Scalable<a href="#scalable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scalable" title="Direct link to Scalable">​</a></h3><p>Chaos Mesh should be scalable, so that we can "plug" new requirements into it conveniently without reinventing the wheel. Specifically, Chaos Mesh must:</p><ul><li>Leverage existing implementations so that fault injection methods can be easily scaled.</li><li>Easily integrate with other testing frameworks.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="designed-for-kubernetes">Designed for Kubernetes<a href="#designed-for-kubernetes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Designed for Kubernetes" title="Direct link to Designed for Kubernetes">​</a></h3><p>In the container world, Kubernetes is the absolute leader. Its growth rate of adoption is far beyond everybody's expectations, and it has won the war of containerized orchestration. In essence, Kubernetes is an operating system for the cloud.</p><p>TiDB is a cloud-native distributed database. Our internal automated testing platform was built on Kubernetes from the beginning. We had hundreds of TiDB clusters running on Kubernetes every day for various experiments, including extensive chaos testing to simulate all kinds of failures or issues in a production environment. To support these chaos experiments, the combination of chaos and Kubernetes became a natural choice and principle for our implementation.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="customresourcedefinitions-design">CustomResourceDefinitions design<a href="#customresourcedefinitions-design" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to CustomResourceDefinitions design" title="Direct link to CustomResourceDefinitions design">​</a></h2><p>Chaos Mesh uses <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CustomResourceDefinitions</a> (CRD) to define chaos objects. In the Kubernetes realm, CRD is a mature solution for implementing custom resources, with abundant implementation cases and toolsets available. Using CRD makes Chaos Mesh naturally integrate with the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p><p>Instead of defining all types of fault injections in a unified CRD object, we allow flexible and separate CRD objects for different types of fault injection. If we add a fault injection method that conforms to an existing CRD object, we scale directly based on this object; if it is a completely new method, we create a new CRD object for it. With this design, chaos object definitions and the logic implementation are extracted from the top level, which makes the code structure clearer. This approach also reduces the degree of coupling and the probability of errors. In addition, Kubernetes' <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controller-runtime</a> is a great wrapper for implementing controllers. This saves us a lot of time because we don't have to repeatedly implement the same set of controllers for each CRD project.</p><p>Chaos Mesh implements the PodChaos, NetworkChaos, and IOChaos objects. The names clearly identify the corresponding fault injection types.</p><p>For example, Pod crashing is a very common problem in a Kubernetes environment. Many native resource objects automatically handle such errors with typical actions such as creating a new Pod. But can our application really deal with such errors? What if the Pod won't start?</p><p>With well-defined actions such as <code>pod-kill</code>, PodChaos can help us pinpoint these kinds of issues more effectively.

It manages the life cycle of CRD objects and schedules chaos experiments. It has object controllers for scheduling CRD object instances, and the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admission-webhooks</a> controller dynamically injects sidecar containers into Pods.</p></li><li><p><strong>chaos-daemon</strong></p><p>Runs as a privileged DaemonSet that can operate network devices on the node and Cgroup.</p></li><li><p><strong>sidecar</strong></p><p>Runs as a special type of container that is dynamically injected into the target Pod by the admission-webhooks. For example, the <code>chaosfs</code> sidecar container runs a fuse-daemon to hijack the I/O operation of the application container.</p></li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chaos Mesh workflow" src="/assets/images/chaos-mesh-workflow-0ae9b7507c78c0e54f10971f6ecca876.png" width="600" height="235" class="img_eJzl"></p><div class="caption-center"> Chaos Mesh workflow </div><p>Here is how these components streamline a chaos experiment:</p><ol><li>Using a YAML file or Kubernetes client, the user creates or updates chaos objects to the Kubernetes API server.</li><li>Chaos Mesh uses the API server to watch the chaos objects and manages the lifecycle of chaos experiments through creating, updating, or deleting events. In this process, controller-manager, chaos-daemon, and sidecar containers work together to inject errors.</li><li>When admission-webhooks receives a Pod creation request, the Pod object to be created is dynamically updated; for example, it is injected into the sidecar container and the Pod.</li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithHideOnScrollNavbar_co_6" id="running-chaos">Running chaos<a href="#running-chaos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Running chaos" title="Direct link to Running chaos">​</a></h2><p>The above sections introduce how we design Chaos Mesh and how it works.

There are still many pieces in progress, with more details to unveil regarding the design, use cases, and development. Stay tuned.</p><p>Open sourcing is just a starting point. In addition to the infrastructure-level chaos experiments introduced in previous sections, we are in the process of supporting a wider range of fault types of finer granularity, such as:</p><ul><li>Injecting errors at the system call and kernel levels with the assistance of eBPF and other tools</li><li>Injecting specific error types into the application function and statement levels by integrating <a href="https://github.com/pingcap/failpoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failpoint</a>, which will cover scenarios that are otherwise impossible with conventional injection methods</li></ul><p>Moving forward, we will continuously improve the Chaos Mesh Dashboard, so that users can easily see if and how their online businesses are impacted by fault injections. In addition, our roadmap includes an easy-to-use fault orchestration interface. We're planning other cool features, such as Chaos Mesh Verifier and Chaos Mesh Cloud.</p><p>If any of these sound interesting to you, join us in building a world class Chaos Engineering platform. May our applications dance in chaos on Kubernetes!</p><p>If you find a bug or think something is missing, feel free to file an <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue</a>, open a PR, or message us in the #project-chaos-mesh channel in the <a href="https://slack.cncf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CNCF Slack</a> workspace.</p><p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/chaos-mesh/chaos-mesh</a></p>]]></content:encoded>
